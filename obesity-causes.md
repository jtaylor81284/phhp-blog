# Obesity Causes

## GxE

One UK Biobank study of over 300,000 people found significant gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects moderated population-level association between proximity to fast-food stores and BMI; in those with high “genetic risk” of obesity there was a strong relationship, but those with low genetic risk were not susceptible to fast-food store proximity [@masonGeneticRiskObesity2020]. Another GxE study of twins found that heritability of obesity was highest in areas of greatest deprivation; in other words, genetic contribution to obese phenotype is highest in more “obesogenic” environments [@owenDoesNeighbourhoodDeprivation2017]. Collectively, these findings indicate the food environment may have substantial contextually contingent influence on food choice.
