abstract = {Estimates from Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals can be biased due to uncontrolled confounding from familial effects. Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies.},

abstract = {Context: Overweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions. Objective: To describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of health conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population. Design and Setting: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994. Participants A total of 16 884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight and obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2) based on National Institutes of Health recommended guidelines. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis. Results: Sixty-three percent of men and 55{\%} of women had a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater. A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with increasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for coronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women. With normal- weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes for men (PR, 18.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 6.7-46.8) and women (PR, 12.9; 95{\%} CI, 5.7-28.1) and gallbladder disease for men (PR, 21.1; 95{\%} CI, 4.1-84.2) and women (PR, 5.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger than in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased with weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups. Conclusions: Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered overweight or obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to prevent and treat obesity rather than just its associated comorbidities.},

abstract = {In three experiments we studied lay observers' attributions of responsibility for an antisocial act (homicide). We systematically varied both the degree to which the action was coerced by external circumstances and the degree to which the actor endorsed and accepted ownership of the act, a psychological state that philosophers have termed "identification." Our findings with respect to identification were highly consistent. The more an actor was identified with an action, the more likely observers were to assign responsibility to the actor, even when the action was performed under constraints so powerful that no other behavioral option was available. Our findings indicate that social cognition involving assignment of responsibility for an action is a more complex process than previous research has indicated. It would appear that laypersons' judgments of moral responsibility may, in some circumstances, accord with philosophical views in which freedom and determinism are regarded to be compatible. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This comprehensive volume analyzes dual markets for regulated substances and services, and aims to provide a framework for their effective regulation. A �dual market� refers to the existence of both a legal and an illegal market for a regulated product or service (for example, prescription drugs). These regulations exist in various countries for a mix of public health, historical, political and cultural reasons. Allowing the legal market to thrive, while trying to eliminate the illegal market, provides a unique challenge for governments and law enforcement. Broken down into nine main sections, the book studies comparative international policies for regulating these �dual markets� from a historical, legal, and cultural perspective. It includes an analysis of the markets for psychoactive substances that are illegal in most countries (such as marijuana, cocaine, opiods and amphetimines), psychoactive substances which are legal in most countries and where consumption is widespread (such as alcohol and tobacco), and services that are generally regulated or illegal (such as sports betting, the sex trade, and gambling). For each of these nine types of markets, contributions focus on the relationship between regulation, the emerging illegal market, and the resulting overall access to these services. This work aims to provide a comprehensive framework from a historical, cultural, and comparative international perspective. It will be of interest to researchers in criminology and criminal justice, particularly with an interest in organized crime, as well as related fields such as sociology, public policy, international relations, and public health.},

abstract = {Background: In many high-income countries, body mass index (BMI)/obesity levels are inversely associated with socio-economic position (SEP). Little is known whether socio-economic patterns in BMI trajectories throughout childhood differ by ethnicity, especially in the United Kingdom. Objectives: To investigate socio-economic disparities in child-to-adolescent BMI trajectories and risks of overweight and obesity during adolescence across ethnic groups. Methods: Mixed-effects fractional polynomial and multinomial regression models were applied to estimate socio-economic differences in BMI trajectories (3-14 years) and risk of overweight/obesity at 14 years, respectively, in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 15 996). Analysis was stratified by ethnicity. Result: Poverty was associated with higher BMI in children of White and South Asian origins, with a small difference at 3 years, which widened with age to 0.75 kg/m2 (95{\%} CI, 0.59-0.91) and 0.77 kg/m2 (0.26-1.27) at 14 years for the White and South Asian groups, respectively. There was a reverse income-BMI association in children of Black (African-Caribbean) origin with the poverty group having a lower BMI (−0.37 kg/m2 [−0.71 to -0.04] at 5 years; −0.95 kg/m2 [−1.79 to −0.11] at 14 years). These patterns also presented with maternal education as a SEP indicator and for obesity at 14 years. Conclusions: Socio-economic advantage may not be universally associated with lower BMI, which should be considered when planning obesity interventions. The positive SEP-BMI association in children of Black origin requires replication and merits further investigation into underpinning mechanisms.},

abstract = {Deficits in impulse control are discussed as key mechanisms for major worldwide health problems such as drug addiction and obesity. For example, obese subjects have difficulty controlling their impulses to overeat when faced with food items. Here, we investigated the role of neural impulse control mechanisms for dietary success in middle-aged obese subjects. Specifically, we used a food-specific delayed gratification paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure eating-related impulse-control in middle-aged obese subjects just before they underwent a twelve-week low calorie diet. As expected, we found that subjects with higher behavioral impulse control subsequently lost more weight. Furthermore, brain activity before the diet in VMPFC and DLPFC correlates with subsequent weight loss. Additionally, a connectivity analysis revealed that stronger functional connectivity between these regions is associated with better dietary success and impulse control. Thus, the degree to which subjects can control their eating impulses might depend on the interplay between control regions (DLPFC) and regions signaling the reward of food (VMPFC). This could potentially constitute a general mechanism that also extends to other disorders such as drug addiction or alcohol abuse. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background Many studies have examined the relationship between the food environment and health-related outcomes, but fewer consider the integrity of measures used to assess the food environment. The present review builds on and makes comparisons with a previous review examining food environment measures and expands the previous review to include a more in depth examination of reliability and validity of measures and study designs employed. Methods We conducted a systematic review of studies measuring the food environment published between 2007 and 2015. We identified these articles through: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases; tables of contents of relevant journals; and the National Cancer Institute's Measures of the Food Environment website. This search yielded 11,928 citations. We retained and abstracted data from 432 studies. Results The most common methodology used to study the food environment was geographic analysis (65{\%} of articles) and the domination of this methodology has persisted since the last review. Only 25.9{\%} of studies in this review reported the reliability of measures and 28.2{\%} reported validity, but this was an improvement as compared to the earlier review. Very few of the studies reported construct validity. Studies reporting measures of the school or worksite environment have decreased since the previous review. Only 13.9{\%} of the studies used a longitudinal design. Conclusions To strengthen research examining the relationship between the food environment and population health, there is a need for robust and psychometrically-sound measures and more sophisticated study designs.},

It uses data from the Health Education Authority's 1993 Health and Lifestyles Survey to examine the barriers people face in accessing a healthy diet. The main findings are that access to food is primarily determined by income, and this is in turn closely related to physical resources available to access healthy food. There is an associated class bias over access to sources of healthy food. The poor have less access to a car, find it harder to get to out-of-town shopping centres and thus are less able to carry and transport food in bulk. The majority of people shop in supermarkets as they report that local shops do not provide the services people demand and that food choice and quality are limited. In tackling food poverty and promoting healthy eating, health promotion practice needs to address these structural issues as opposed to relying on psycho-social models of education based on the povision of information and choice.},

abstract = {Methods: We linked economic data for 94 foods and beverages in the UK Consumer Price Index to food and nutrient data from the UK Department of Health's National Diet and Nutrition Survey, producing a novel dataset across the period 2002-2012. Each item was assigned to a food group and also categorised as either "more healthy" or "less healthy" using a nutrient profiling model developed by the Food Standards Agency. We tested statistical significance using a t-test and repeated measures ANOVA.
Objectives: The UK government has noted the public health importance of food prices and the affordability of a healthy diet. Yet, methods for tracking change over time have not been established. We aimed to investigate the prices of more and less healthy foods over time using existing government data on national food prices and nutrition content. Copyright:
Results: The mean (standard deviation) 2012 price/1000 kcal was {\pounds}2.50 (0.29) for less healthy items and {\pounds}7.49 (1.27) for more healthy items. The ANOVA results confirmed that all prices had risen over the period 2002-2012, but more healthy items rose faster than less healthy ones in absolute terms:{\pounds}0.17 compared to {\pounds}0.07/1000 kcal per year on average for more and less healthy items, respectively (p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions: Since 2002, more healthy foods and beverages have been consistently more expensive than less healthy ones, with a growing gap between them. This trend is likely to make healthier diets less affordable over time, which may have implications for individual food security and population health, and it may exacerbate social inequalities in health. The novel data linkage employed here could be used as the basis for routine food price monitoring to inform public health policy.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is a significant issue for health and social policy, with major ramifications for economic productivity across the globe. In Western industrialized countries, however, it impacts on the population along traditional lines of economic disadvantage, its incidence being inversely related to income and education. As a health issue and matter for policy intervention, obesity is frequently presented in public discourse within an existing moral framework which links illness with moral failure. This is reminiscent of the historical treatment of poverty. It will be argued in this paper that the convergence of moralized discourses around poverty and illness is represented most visibly and powerfully in the issue of obesity, resulting in policy which addresses these moral 'shortcomings' at the expense of attention to the structures which create ill health and poverty. An alternative social-structural perspective will be proposed as a potentially more helpful frame for addressing the obesity issue.},

abstract = {Luck Egalitarianism has frequently been discussed in the recent literature because of the potential impact of this theory on health financing. Luck Egalitarianism puts forth a theory of distributive justice which says that the fundamental aim of equality is to compensate people for undeserved bad luck such as being born with poor native endowments, having difficult family circumstances or suffering from accidents and illness. On the other hand, if individuals face ill health because of faults of their own, then society has no duty to supply health services to them. Many arguments for and against this theory have been raised since it was first introduced. The proponents of Luck Egalitarianism focus on the concepts that free choice and respecting the autonomy of the individual determine whether health services are deserved. The criticisms against the concept of Luck Egalitarianism are that it is harsh to the needy and abandons the wretched, discriminates against the disabled, is against basic humanitarian principles, is incompatible with human dignity, and is in dissonance with real life. We agree with the basic proposition of Luck Egalitarian theory, which states that “inequalities deriving from unchosen features of people's circumstances are unjust and therefore should be compensated for”. Our agreement leads us to an opposite conclusion. We propose that the “unchosen features of people's circumstances” include more than personal disadvantages. The social features to be included in the context of inequalities deriving from unchosen features of peoples circumstances are, socioeconomic status (SES), access to social determinants of health, and the ethnic, cultural and religious identity of individuals. Our other propositions are the mutable character of choices which makes individual responsibility of preferences implausible; the problematic causal relationship between responsibility and ill-health; the disregard of the motives behind decisions; problems with implementation in real health service circumstances; and the contradictory nature of Luck Egalitarianism for principles of medical ethics. These arguments draw attention to possible ethical and practical consequences of implementation of health policies arising from Luck Egalitarian view for patients and for health care providers. In this paper, we will first define Luck Egalitarianism. Then, we will discuss arguments for and against the theory in the literature. Our final task is to suggest additional criticisms of the theory and justify them.},

abstract = {Background: There is limited evidence on which risk factors attenuate income inequalities in child overweight and obesity; whether and why these inequalities widen as children age. Method: Eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty five singletons had complete data at age 5 and 9384 at age 11 from the Millennium Cohort Study (UK). Overweight (age 5: 15{\%}; age 11: 20{\%}) and obesity (age 5: 5{\%}; age 11: 6{\%}) were defined using the International Obesity Taskforce body mass index cut-points. To measure socioeconomic inequalities, we used quintiles of family income and as risk factors, we considered markers of maternal health behaviours and of children's physical activity, sedentary behaviours and diet. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were used. Results: The unadjusted analyses revealed stark income inequalities in the risk of obesity at age 5 and 11. At age 5, children in the bottom income quintile had 2.0 (95{\%} CI: 1.4-2.8) increased relative risk of being obese whilst at age 11 they had 3.0 (95{\%} CI: 2.0-4.5) increased risk compared to children in the top income quintile. Similar income inequalities in the risk of overweight emerged by age 11. Physical activity and diet were particularly important in explaining inequalities. Income inequalities in obesity and overweight widened significantly between age 5 and 11 and a similar set of risk factors protected against upward and promoted downward movements across weight categories. Conclusions: To reduce income inequalities in overweight and obesity and their widening across childhood the results support the need of early interventions which take account of multiple risk factors.},

abstract = {Context: The rise in obesity in the United States may slow or even reverse the long-term trend of increasing life expectancy. Like many risk factors for disease, obesity results from behavior and shows a social gradient. Especially among women, obesity is more common among lower-income individuals, those with less education, and some ethnic/racial minorities. Methods: This article examines the underlying assumptions and implications for policy and the interventions of the two predominant models used to explain the causes of obesity and also suggests a synthesis that avoids "blaming the victim" while acknowledging the role of individuals' health behaviors in weight maintenance. Findings: (1) The medical model focuses primarily on treatment, addressing individuals' personal behaviors as the cause of their obesity. An underlying assumption is that as independent agents, individuals make informed choices. Interventions are providing information and motivating individuals to modify their behaviors. (2) The public health model concentrates more on prevention and sees the roots of obesity in an obesogenic environment awash in influences that lead individuals to engage in health-damaging behaviors. Interventions are modifying environmental forces through social policies. (3) There is a tension between empowering individuals to manage their weight through diet and exercise and blaming them for failure to do so. Patterns of obesity by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status highlight this tension. (4) Environments differ in their health-promoting resources; for example, poorer communities have fewer supermarkets, more fast-food outlets, and fewer accessible and safe recreational opportunities. Conclusions: A social justice perspective facilitates a synthesis of both models. This article proposes the concept of "behavioral justice" to convey the principle that individuals are responsible for engaging in health-promoting behaviors but should be held accountable only when they have adequate resources to do so. This perspective maintains both individuals' control and accountability for behaviors and society's responsibility to provide health-promoting environments. {\textcopyright} 2009 Milbank Memorial Fund.},

abstract = {Obesity is a persistently newsworthy topic for the UK press and in recent years levels of coverage have increased. In this study, we examine the ways in which obesity has been framed by the press over a ten-year period (2008–2017), focussing both on areas of stability and change. The analysis is based on a {\~{}}36 million-word database of all UK newspaper articles mentioning the words ‘obese' or ‘obesity' published within this time frame and draws upon techniques from corpus linguistics – a collection of computational methods for examining recurrent linguistic patterns in large bodies of language data. Our analysis shows that, over time, obesity is represented increasingly as a biomedical problem that is both caused and should be prevented by individual action. Meanwhile, focus on wider environmental determinants of health, including the role of Government and the food industry, decreases over time. In the paper, we situate these trends within the wider context of UK society and argue that they both represent the increasing dominance of neoliberal models of health but also have the potential to contribute to weight stigma and the blaming of individuals. Accordingly, it is argued that the press should seek greater balance in its reporting of the potential causes of and solutions to obesity, as well as closer alignment with scientific evidence. By doing so, the press could begin to report on obesity in a way that raises useful public awareness around the topic and which challenges some of the stigma that currently attends to this social justice issue.},

abstract = {A variety of studies suggest that efficient treatments to induce short-term dietary success in obesity exist. However, sustained maintenance of reduced weight is rare as a large proportion of patients start to regain weight when treatment is discontinued. Thus, from a clinical perspective, it would be desirable to identify factors that counteract post-diet weight regain across longer time-scales. To address this question, we extended our previous work on neural impulse control mechanisms of short-term dietary success in obesity and now investigated the mechanisms counteracting long-term weight regain after a diet. Specifically, we measured neural impulse control during a delay discounting task with fMRI at two time points, i.e. the beginning ('T0') and the end ('T12') of a one-year follow-up interval after a 12-week diet. Then, we tested whether activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at T0 and whether activity changes across the follow-up period (T0. -. T12) are linked to success in weight maintenance. The analyses conducted show that control-related DLPFC activity at T0 was coupled to the degree of success in weight maintenance. Consistently, also behavioral measures of control were linked to the degree of success in maintenance. A direct comparison of neural and behavioral control parameters for prognostic weight change modeling revealed that neural signals were more informative. Taken together, neural impulse control in the DLPFC measured with fMRI directly after a diet predicts real-world diet success in obese patients across extended time periods.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The relationship between income and life expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level, time trend, and geographic variability in the association between income and life expectancy and to identify factors related to small area variation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records. These data were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated with differences in life expectancy. EXPOSURE: Pretax household earnings as a measure of income. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Relationship between income and life expectancy; trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income group; and factors associated with differences in life expectancy across areas. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1 408 287 218 person-year observations for individuals aged40 to 76years (mean age, 53.0years; median household earnings among working individuals, {\$}61 175 per year). Therewere 4 114 380 deaths amongmen(mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000) and 2 694 808deathsamongwomen(mortalityrate, 375.1 per100 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gapin life expectancy between the richest 1{\%} and poorest 1{\%} of individuals was 14.6 years (95{\%}CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) formen and 10.1 years (95{\%}CI,9.9 to 10.3 years) forwomen. Second, inequality in life expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years formenand 2.91 years forwomen in the top 5{\%}of the income distribution, but by only0.32 yearsformenand0.04yearsforwomeninthebottom5{\%}(P {\textless}.001forthedifferencesforbothsexes). Third, life expectancy for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the bottomincomequartile, lifeexpectancydifferedbyapproximately4.5yearsbetweenareaswiththe highestandlowest longevity.Changes inlifeexpectancybetween2001and2014 rangedfromgains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups increased over time. However, the association between life expectancy and income varied substantially across areas; differences in longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area characteristics.},

abstract = {Background: Retail food environments (foodscapes) are a recognised determinant of eating behaviours and may contribute to inequalities in diet. However, findings from studies measuring socioeconomic inequality in the foodscape have been mixed, which may be due to methodological differences. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare exposure to the foodscape by socioeconomic position using different measures, to test whether the presence, direction or amplitude of differences was sensitive to the choice of foodscape metric or socioeconomic indicator. Methods: A sample of 10,429 adults aged 30-64years with valid home address data were obtained from the Fenland Study, UK. Of this sample, 7270 participants also had valid work location data. The sample was linked to data on food outlets obtained from local government records. Foodscape metrics included count, density and proximity of takeaway outlets and supermarkets, and the percentage of takeaway outlets relative to all food outlets. Exposure metrics were area-based (lower super output areas), and person-centred (proximity to nearest; Euclidean and Network buffers at 800m, 1km, and 1mile). Person-centred buffers were constructed using home and work locations. Socioeconomic status was measured at the area-level (2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation) and the individual-level (highest educational attainment; equivalised household income). Participants were classified into socioeconomic groups and average exposures estimated. Results were analysed using the statistical and percent differences between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups. Results: In area-based measures, the most deprived areas contained higher takeaway outlet densities (p{\textless}0.001). However, in person-centred metrics lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower exposure to takeaway outlets and supermarkets (all home-based exposures p{\textless}0.001) and socioeconomic differences were greatest at the smallest buffer sizes. Socioeconomic differences in exposure was similar for home and combined home and work measures. Measuring takeaway exposure as a percentage of all outlets reversed the socioeconomic differences; the lowest socioeconomic groups had a higher percentage of takeaway outlets compared to the middle and highest groups (p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: We compared approaches to measuring socioeconomic variation in the foodscape and found that the association was sensitive to the metric used. In particular, the direction of association varied between area- and person-centred measures and between absolute and relative outlet measures. Studies need to consider the most appropriate measure for the research question, and may need to consider multiple measures as a single measure may be context dependent.},

abstract = {In low income countries worldwide, rising standards of living have spurred an unprecedented rise in obesity. However, in numerous wealthy countries the trend frequently reverses with poorer and less educated women more likely to be overweight than their wealthier compatriots. One prominent explanation for this reverse gradient is that economic deprivation leads to food choices which paradoxically increase energy intake. If true, this would challenge current evolutionary accounts for the modern obesity epidemic and have serious implications for how policy makers tackle increasing obesity in the US and worldwide. In this article, we critically review the hypothesis that deprivation leads people to choose cheaper foods which in turn foster overconsumption of energy. Though the hypothesis is consistent with numerous cross-sectional studies, available longitudinal studies from high-, middle-, and low-income countries show the reverse-that when populations experience resource declines, they experience either declines in BMI or decelerations in BMI growth. Most notably, the recent recession in the US coincides with a clear deceleration in women's obesity across income groups. We conclude by briefly reviewing other plausible explanations for the reverse gradient among women in developing countries. Finally, we discuss how theoretical perspectives and comparative, historical approaches from human biology are useful tools for examining the current wealth of hypotheses about obesity in population health. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This study aims to evaluate whether the pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in physical and mental functioning as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) differs among employees in Britain, Finland, and Japan and whether work characteristics contribute to some of the health inequalities. The participants were 7340 (5122 men and 2218 women) British employees, 2297 (1638 men and 659 women) Japanese employees, and 8164 (1649 men and 6515 women) Finnish employees. All the participants were civil servants aged 40-60 years. Both male and female low grade employees had poor physical functioning in all cohorts. British and Japanese male low grade employees tended to have poor mental functioning but the associations were significant only for Japanese men. No consistent employment-grade differences in mental functioning were observed among British and Japanese women. Among Finnish men and women, high grade employees had poor mental functioning. In all cohorts, high grade employees had high control, high demands and long work hours. The grade differences in poor physical functioning and disadvantaged work characteristics among non-manual workers were somewhat smaller in the Finnish cohort than in the British and Japanese cohorts. Low control, high demands, and both short and long work hours were associated with poor functioning. When work characteristics were adjusted for, the socioeconomic differences in poor functioning were mildly attenuated in men, but the differences increased slightly in women. This study reconfirms the generally observed pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in health for physical functioning but not for mental functioning. The role of work characteristics in the relationship between socioeconomic status and health differed between men and women but was modest overall. We suggest that these differences in the pattern and magnitude of grade differences in work characteristics and health among the 3 cohorts may be attributable to the different welfare regimes among the 3 countries. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Working long hours might have adverse health effects, but whether this is true for all socioeconomic status groups is unclear. In this meta-analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, we investigated the role of long working hours as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Methods: We identified four published studies through a systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase up to April 30, 2014. Study inclusion criteria were English-language publication; prospective design (cohort study); investigation of the effect of working hours or overtime work; incident diabetes as an outcome; and relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95{\%} CIs, or sufficient information to calculate these estimates. Additionally, we used unpublished individual-level data from 19 cohort studies from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working-Populations Consortium and international open-access data archives. Effect estimates from published and unpublished data from 222120 men and women from the USA, Europe, Japan, and Australia were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: During 1.7 million person-years at risk, 4963 individuals developed diabetes (incidence 29 per 10000 person-years). The minimally adjusted summary risk ratio for long (≥55 h per week) compared with standard working hours (35-40 h) was 1.07 (95{\%} CI 0.89-1.27, difference in incidence three cases per 10000 person-years) with significant heterogeneity in study-specific estimates (I{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=53{\%}, p=0.0016). In an analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, the association between long working hours and diabetes was evident in the low socioeconomic status group (risk ratio 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.57, difference in incidence 13 per 10000 person-years, I{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=0{\%}, p=0.4662), but was null in the high socioeconomic status group (1.00, 95{\%} CI 0.80-1.25, incidence difference zero per 10000 person-years, I{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=15{\%}, p=0.2464). The association in the low socioeconomic status group was robust to adjustment for age, sex, obesity, and physical activity, and remained after exclusion of shift workers. Interpretation: In this meta-analysis, the link between longer working hours and type 2 diabetes was apparent only in individuals in the low socioeconomic status groups.

abstract = {Many health disparities in the United States are linked to inequalities in education and income. This review focuses on the relation between obesity and diet quality, dietary energy density, and energy costs. Evidence is provided to support the following points. First, the highest rates of obesity occur among population groups with the highest poverty rates and the least education. Second, there is an inverse relation between energy density (MJ/kg) and energy cost ({\$}/MJ), such that energy-dense foods composed of refined grains, added sugars, or fats may represent the lowest-cost option to the consumer. Third, the high energy density and palatability of sweets and fats are associated with higher energy intakes, at least in clinical and laboratory studies. Fourth, poverty and food insecurity are associated with lower food expenditures, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and lower-quality diets. A reduction in diet costs in linear programming models leads to high-fat, energy-dense diets that are similar in composition to those consumed by low-income groups. Such diets are more affordable than are prudent diets based on lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit. The association between poverty and obesity may be mediated, in part, by the low cost of energy-dense foods and may be reinforced by the high palatability of sugar and fat. This economic framework provides an explanation for the observed links between socioeconomic variables and obesity when taste, dietary energy density, and diet costs are used as intervening variables. More and more Americans are becoming overweight and obese while consuming more added sugars and fats and spending a lower percentage of their disposable income on food. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.},

abstract = {Background: Features of the local fast food environment have been hypothesized to contribute to the greater prevalence of obesity in deprived neighborhoods. However, few studies have investigated whether fast food outlets are more likely to be found in poorer areas, and those that have are local case studies. In this paper, using national-level data, we examine the association between neighborhood deprivation and the density of McDonald's restaurants in small census areas (neighborhoods) in Scotland and England. Methods: Data on population, deprivation, and the location of McDonald's Restaurants were obtained for 38,987 small areas in Scotland and England (6505 "data zones" in Scotland, and 32,482 "super output areas" in England) in January 2005. Measures of McDonald's restaurants per 1000 people for each area were calculated, and areas were divided into quintiles of deprivation. Associations between neighborhood deprivation and outlet density were examined during February 2005, using one-way analysis of variance in Scotland, England, and both countries combined. Results: Statistically significant positive associations were found between neighborhood deprivation and the mean number of McDonald's outlets per 1000 people for Scotland (p{\textless}0.001), England (p{\textless}0.001), and both countries combined (p{\textless}0.001). These associations were broadly linear with greater mean numbers of outlets per 1000 people occurring as deprivation levels increased. Conclusions: Observed associations between presence or absence of fast food outlets and neighborhood deprivation may provide support for environmental explanations for the higher prevalence of obesity in poor neighborhoods. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {Objective: Chronic cortisol exposure is hypothesized to contribute to obesity. This study examined associations between hair cortisol concentrations, a novel indicator of long-term cortisol exposure, and adiposity in a large population-based sample. Methods: Data were from 2,527 men and women aged 54 and older (98{\%} white British) participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp-nearest 2 cm hair segment, and height, weight, and waist circumference were objectively measured. Covariates included age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking status, diabetes, and arthritis. Results: In cross-sectional analyses, hair cortisol concentrations were positively correlated with weight (r = 0.102, P {\textless} 0.001), BMI (r = 0.101, P {\textless} 0.001), and waist circumference (r = 0.082, P = 0.001) and were significantly elevated in participants with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) (F = 6.58, P = 0.001) and raised waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women) (F = 4.87, P = 0.027). Hair cortisol levels were also positively associated with the persistence of obesity (F = 12.70, P {\textless} 0.001), evaluated in retrospect over 4 years. Conclusions: Chronic exposure to elevated cortisol concentrations, assessed in hair, is associated with markers of adiposity and with the persistence of obesity over time.},

abstract = {Background: Some public health measures restrict personal freedom more than others, and deciding what type of measure will be appropriate and effective has long been a problem for policy makers. Existing bioethical frameworks are often not well suited to address the problems of public health. Methods: The Nuffield Council on Bioethics set up an expert working party to examine the ethical issues surrounding public health in January 2006. Following evidence gathering and a public consultation exercise, the Council published its conclusions and recommendations in the report 'Public health: ethical issues' in November 2007. Results: A spectrum of views exists on the relationship between the state's authority and the individual. The Council set out a proposal to capture the best of the libertarian and paternalistic approaches, in what it calls the 'stewardship model'. This model suggests guiding principles for making decisions about public health policies, and highlights some key principles including Mill's harm principle, caring for the vulnerable, autonomy and consent. An 'intervention ladder' is also proposed, which provides a way of thinking about the acceptability of different public health measures. The report then applies these principles to a number of case studies: infectious diseases, obesity, alcohol and tobacco, and fluoridation of water supplies. Conclusions: The idea of a 'nanny state' is often rejected, but the state has a duty to look after the health of everyone, and sometimes that means guiding or restricting people's choices. On the other hand, the state must consider a number of principles when designing public health programmes, and justification is required if any of these principles are to be infringed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society for Public Health.},

abstract = {Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in childhood body-mass index (BMI) have been documented in high-income countries; however, uncertainty exists with regard to how they have changed over time, how inequalities in the composite parts (ie, weight and height) of BMI have changed, and whether inequalities differ in magnitude across the outcome distribution. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how socioeconomic inequalities in childhood and adolescent weight, height, and BMI have changed over time in Britain. Methods: We used data from four British longitudinal, observational, birth cohort studies: the 1946 Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (1946 NSHD), 1958 National Child Development Study (1958 NCDS), 1970 British Cohort Study (1970 BCS), and 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (2001 MCS). BMI (kg/m 2 ) was derived in each study from measured weight and height. Childhood socioeconomic position was indicated by the father's occupational social class, measured at the ages of 10–11 years. We examined associations between childhood socioeconomic position and anthropometric outcomes at age 7 years, 11 years, and 15 years to assess socioeconomic inequalities in each cohort using gender-adjusted linear regression models. We also used multilevel models to examine whether these inequalities widened or narrowed from childhood to adolescence, and quantile regression was used to examine whether the magnitude of inequalities differed across the outcome distribution. Findings: In England, Scotland, and Wales, 5362 singleton births were enrolled in 1946, 17 202 in 1958, 17 290 in 1970, and 16 404 in 2001. Low socioeconomic position was associated with lower weight at childhood and adolescent in the earlier-born cohorts (1946–70), but with higher weight in the 2001 MCS cohort. Weight disparities became larger from childhood to adolescence in the 2001 MCS but not the earlier-born cohorts (p interaction =0{\textperiodcentered}001). Low socioeconomic position was also associated with shorter height in all cohorts, yet the absolute magnitude of this difference narrowed across generations. These disparities widened with age in the 2001 MCS (p interaction =0{\textperiodcentered}002) but not in the earlier-born cohorts. There was little inequality in childhood BMI in the 1946–70 cohorts, whereas inequalities were present in the 2001 cohort and widened from childhood to adolescence in the 1958–2001 cohorts (p interaction {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05 in the later three cohorts but not the 1946 NSHD). BMI and weight disparities were larger in the 2001 cohort than in the earlier-born cohorts, and systematically larger at higher quantiles—eg, in the 2001 MCS at age 11 years, a difference of 0{\textperiodcentered}98 kg/m 2 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}63–1{\textperiodcentered}33) in the 50th BMI percentile and 2{\textperiodcentered}54 kg/m 2 (1{\textperiodcentered}85–3{\textperiodcentered}22) difference at the 90th BMI percentile were observed. Interpretation: Over the studied period (1953–2015), socioeconomic-associated inequalities in weight reversed and those in height narrowed, whereas differences in BMI and obesity emerged and widened. These substantial changes highlight the impact of societal changes on child and adolescent growth and the insufficiency of previous policies in preventing obesity and its socioeconomic inequality. As such, new and effective policies are required to reduce BMI inequalities in childhood and adolescence.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To examine the association between education level and food purchasing behaviour and the contribution of dietary knowledge to this relationship; and the association between household income and purchasing behaviour and the contribution made by subjective perceptions about the cost of healthy food. DESIGN AND SETTING The study was conducted in Brisbane City (Australia) in 2000. The sample was selected using a stratified two-stage cluster design. Data were collected by face-to-face interview from residents of private dwellings (n=1003), and the response rate was 66.4{\%}. Dietary knowledge was measured using a 20-item index that assessed general knowledge about food, nutrition, health and their interrelationships. Food-cost concern was measured using a three-item scale derived from principal components analysis (alpha=0.647). Food purchasing was measured using a 16-item index that reflected a household's purchase of grocery items that were consistent (or otherwise) with dietary guideline recommendations. Associations among the variables were analysed using linear regression with adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS Significant associations were found between education, household income and food purchasing behaviour. Food shoppers with low levels of education, and those residing in low-income households, were least likely to purchase foods that were comparatively high in fibre and low in fat, salt and sugar. Socio-economic differences in dietary knowledge represented part of the pathway through which educational attainment exerts an influence on diet; and food purchasing differences by household income were related to diet in part via food-cost concern. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that socio-economic differences in food purchasing behaviour may contribute to the relationship between socio-economic position and food and nutrient intakes, and, by extension, to socio-economic health inequalities for diet-related disease. Further, socio-economic differences in dietary knowledge and concerns about the cost of healthy food play an important role in these relationships and hence should form the focus of future health promotion efforts directed at reducing health inequalities and encouraging the general population to improve their diets.},

Animal models and human neuroimaging experiments provide complementary insights, yet efforts to integrate the two are often complicated by limitations inherent in drawing comparisons between unrelated studies with disparate designs. Translating from a rodent model of chronic stress where we have shown reversible disruption of PFC function,weshowthat psychosocial stress induces long-lasting but reversible impairments in behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of PFC function in humans. Twenty healthy adults, exposed to 1 month of psychosocial stress, confirmed by a validated rating scale, were scanned while performing a PFC-dependent attention-shifting task. One month later, they returned for a second scanning session after a period of reduced stress, and their performance was compared with a twice-scanned, matched group of low-stress controls. Psychosocial stress selectively impaired attentional control and disrupted functional connectivity within a frontoparietal network that mediates attention shifts. These effects were reversible: after one month of reduced stress, the same subjects showed no significant differences from controls. These results highlight the plasticity of PFC networks in healthy human subjects and suggest one mechanism by which disrupted plasticity may contribute to cognitive impairments characteristic of stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions in susceptible individuals. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The concept of addiction is loaded with connotations and is often used for its political as much as its medical utility. The scientific case for 'food addiction' as a clinical phenotype currently rests on its association with generic diagnostic criteria for substance-related disorders being applied to everyday foods and eating-related problems. This has fused the concept of obesity with addiction regardless of whether it fits the definition. The hedonic, or reward, system can account for the ingestion of foods and drugs, confirming that they share neural substrates that differentiate liking and wanting. These are normal processes that are recruited for natural homeostatic behaviours and can explain the phenomenon of hedonic overeating as a consequence of human motivation pushed to extremes by an obesogenic environment. Food addiction constitutes a medicalization of common eating behaviours, taking on the properties of a disease. The use of this medical language has implications for the way in which society views overeating and obesity.},

abstract = {In a study of 1700 members of the UK general public in 1992 in which face-to-face interviews were conducted, factors thought important in a healthy diet were (in descending order) more fiber, less sugar, less fat, less salt, and more starchy foods. Of common nutritional terms there was most confidence in explaining the meaning of fiber and least in the meaning of monounsaturated fatty acids. Most nutritional information came from the media but the credibility of this information was low. Fifty-three percent said that a conversation with their general practitioner (GP) was a source of advice they trusted. In a survey of 150 GPs and 50 practice nurses in 1992, lack of confidence was found to be common concerning the meaning of several nutritional terms, especially extrinsic sugars, NSP (nonstarch polysaccharide), and trans fatty acids. GPs were confident they could explain the link between diet and heart disease but were not sure about the value of starch in the diet. Both GPs and practice nurses were dissatisfied with their training in nutrition, both before and after registration. General practice staff thought that personal ill health was the most important motivator for dietary change among their patients. They thought that apathy and dietary conservatism were the most common barriers to people changing their diet. However, the public positioned lack of knowledge as the biggest obstacle. Surveys reported here showed that people's knowledge of sources of fat, calcium, and iron is often unreliable.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the issue of poverty affecting economic decision-making. By critically evaluating existing studies, the authors propose a structural model detailing the cognitive mechanism involved in how poverty negatively impacts economic decision-making, and explores evidence supporting the basis for the formation of this model. The suggested mechanism consists of a relationship between poverty and four other factors: (1) cognitive load (e.g., experiencing negative affect and stress); (2) executive functions (e.g., attention, working memory, and self-control); (3) intuition/deliberation in decision-making; and (4) economic decision-making (e.g., time-discounting and risk preference), with a final addition of financial literacy as a covariate. This paper focuses on shortfalls in published research, and delves further into the proposed model.},

abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is a leading cause of obesity and premature mortality. We aimed to examine the relation between active commuting and obesity in mid-life using objectively measured anthropometric data from UK Biobank. Methods: Cross-sectional, observational data from UK Biobank were used. These were collected from individuals aged 40-69 years who visited 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported commuting method was operationalised into seven categories, ordered to reflect typical levels of physical exertion. The outcomes assessed were BMI (based on objectively measured weight and height) and percentage body fat. Hypothesised confounders were income, area deprivation, urban or rural residence, education, alcohol intake, smoking, leisure physical activity, recreational walking, occupational physical activity, general health, and limiting illness or disability. We used sex-stratified multivariate linear-regression models. Findings: Final complete case sample sizes were 72 999 men and 83 667 women for the BMI outcome and 72 139 men and 82 788 women for the percentage body fat outcome. Active commuting was significantly and independently associated with reduced BMI and percentage body fat for both sexes, with a graded pattern apparent across the seven commuting categories. In fully adjusted models, compared with their car-only counterparts, mixed public and active transport commuters had significantly lower BMI (men: $\beta$ coefficient -1{\textperiodcentered}00 kg/m2 [95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}14 to -0{\textperiodcentered}87], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; women: -0{\textperiodcentered}67 kg/m2 [-0{\textperiodcentered}86 to -0{\textperiodcentered}47], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -1{\textperiodcentered}71 kg/m2 [95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}86 to -1{\textperiodcentered}56], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; women: -1{\textperiodcentered}65 kg/m2 [-1{\textperiodcentered}92 to -1{\textperiodcentered}38], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Similarly, compared with car-only commuters, mixed public transport and active commuters had significantly lower percentage body fat (men: -1{\textperiodcentered}32{\%} [95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}53 to -1{\textperiodcentered}12], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; women: -1{\textperiodcentered}10{\%} [-1{\textperiodcentered}40 to -0{\textperiodcentered}81], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -2{\textperiodcentered}75{\%} [95{\%} CI -3{\textperiodcentered}03 to -2{\textperiodcentered}48], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; women: -3{\textperiodcentered}26{\%} [-3{\textperiodcentered}80 to -2{\textperiodcentered}71], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: This study is the first to use UK Biobank data to address the topic of active commuting and obesity and shows robust, independent associations between active commuting and healthier bodyweight and composition. These findings support the case for interventions to promote active travel as a population-level policy response for prevention of obesity in mid-life. Funding: UK Medical Research Council.},

abstract = {Understanding how genetics influences obesity, brain activity and eating behaviour will add important insight for developing strategies for weight-loss treatment, as obesity may stem from different causes and as individual feeding behaviour may depend on genetic differences. To this end, we examined how an obesity risk allele for the FTO gene affects brain activity in response to food images of different caloric content via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirty participants homozygous for the rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism were shown images of low- or high-calorie food while brain activity was measured via fMRI. In a whole-brain analysis, we found that people with the FTO risk allele genotype (AA) had increased activity compared with the non-risk (TT) genotype in the posterior cingulate, cuneus, precuneus and putamen. Moreover, higher body mass index in the AA genotype was associated with reduced activity to food images in areas important for emotion (cingulate cortex), but also in areas important for impulse control (frontal gyri and lentiform nucleus). Lastly, we corroborate our findings with behavioural scales for the behavioural inhibition and activation systems. Our results suggest that the two genotypes are associated with differential neural processing of food images, which may influence weight status through diminished impulse control and reward processing.},

abstract = {Impulsivity refers to a tendency to act rapidly without full consideration of consequences. The trait is thought to result from the interaction between high arousal responses to potential rewards and poor self-control. Studies have suggested that impulsivity confers vulnerability to both addiction and obesity. However, results in this area are unclear, perhaps due to the high phenotypic complexity of addictions and obesity. Focusing on impulsivity, the aim of this review is to tackle the putative overlaps between addiction and obesity in four domains: (1) personality research, (2) neurocognitive tasks, (3) brain imaging, and (4) clinical evidence. We suggest that three impulsivity-related domains are particularly relevant for our understanding of similarities between addiction and obesity: lower self-control (high Disinhibition/low Conscientiousness), reward sensitivity (high Extraversion/Positive Emotionality), and negative affect (high Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality). Neurocognitive studies have shown that obesity and addiction are both associated with increased impulsive decision-making and attention bias in response to drug or food cues, respectively. Mirroring this, obesity and different forms of addiction seem to exhibit similar alterations in functional MRI brain activity in response to reward processing and during self-control tasks. Overall, our review provides an integrative approach to understand those facets of obesity that present similarities to addictive behaviors. In addition, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting inhibitory control may represent a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity.},

The model includes four sets of determinate variables: perceived threat of a high-fat diet, barriers to a healthier diet, food choices made for health reasons, and self-efficacy, as well as sociodemographic background factors. One hundred fifty-five married couples were selected by a random area sample from the state of Iowa. Husbands and wives were interviewed separately in the home. The results partially support the HBM as applied to a nutrition domain and revealed interesting gender differences. For wives the cost of healthy diet changes had an effect on PCF. For husbands, perceived threat and self-efficacy had an effect on PCF. The differences are discussed on the basis of gender roles in the home and gender socialization. {\textcopyright} 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Background: Household income (as a marker of socioeconomic position) and neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure may be related to diet and body weight, which are key risk factors for non-communicable diseases. However, the research evidence is equivocal. Moreover, understanding the double burden of these factors is a matter of public health importance. The purpose of this study was to test associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to frequency of consumption of processed meat and multiple measures of adiposity, and to examine possible interactions. Methods: We employed an observational, cross-sectional study design. In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38-72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income ({\pounds}/year, four groups) and GIS-derived neighbourhood fast-food outlet proportion (counts of fast-food outlets as a percentage of all food outlets, quartiles). Multivariable regression models estimated main effects and interactions (additive and multiplicative) of household income and fast-food outlet proportion on odds of self-reported frequent processed meat consumption ({\textgreater} 1/week), measured BMI (kg/m2), body fat ({\%}), and odds of obesity (BMI ≥ 30). Results: Income and fast-food proportion were independently, systematically associated with BMI, body fat, obesity and frequent processed meat consumption. Odds of obesity were greater for lowest income participants compared to highest (OR = 1.54, 95{\%} CI: 1.41, 1.69) and for those most-exposed to fast-food outlets compared to least-exposed (OR = 1.51, 95{\%} CI: 1.40, 1.64). In jointly classified models, lowest income and highest fast-food outlet proportion in combination were associated with greater odds of obesity (OR = 2.43, 95{\%} CI: 2.09, 2.84), with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI = 0.03). Results were similar for frequent processed meat consumption models. There was no evidence of interaction on a multiplicative scale between fast-food outlet proportion and household income on each of BMI (P = 0.230), obesity (P = 0.054) and frequent processed meat consumption (P = 0.725). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated independent associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to diet and multiple objective measures of adiposity, in a large sample of UK adults. Moreover, we provide evidence of the double burden of low income and an unhealthy neighbourhood food environment, furthering our understanding of how these factors contribute jointly to social inequalities in health.},

Design: Overweight and obese mothers participated in an 8-week weight loss intervention encompassing diet, physical activity, and behavioral modification. Anthropometrics, demographic, dietary, and physical activity questionnaires were administered at weeks 0 and 8; anthropometrics were re-evaluated at week 24. Subjects: Mothers (N=91) of a 1–3 year old child; body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2; non-breastfeeding; age 18–45 years; income {\textless} 200{\%} of federal poverty index; Hispanic, African American, or white; and English-speaking were recruited from Special Supplemental Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) and public health clinics. Intervention Measures of Outcome: Weight loss in mothers and improvements in diet (reduction in calories, fat, snacks/desserts, sweetened beverages, and increases in fruit, vegetables) and activity in mothers and children. Results: Weight loss in mothers was modest (−2.7 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) and sustained at week 24 (−2.8 kg, p {\textless} 0.001), and children gained in height and weight as expected for normal growth (p {\textless} 0.001). Initial energy intakes of children exceeded Estimated Energy Requirements (123{\%}) and were reduced to acceptable levels post-intervention (102{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001); additional beneficial changes in children's diets were decreased total (47.7 to 39.9 g/day) and saturated fat (19.2 to 16.6 g/day), high-fat snacks/desserts (1.6 to 0.9 servings/day), added fats (81.8 to 40.9{\%} using), sweetened beverages (0.8 to 0.4 servings/day), and fast food consumption (11.6 to 6.6{\%} of meals), and increased home-prepared meals (63.2 to 71.6{\%} of meals) (p {\textless} 0.01 for all). Physical activity scores improved by 7{\%} in children (p {\textless} 0.05). Comparable changes in food choices and activity also were seen in mothers. Conclusion: Offering weight loss classes was a successful method of enticing low-income women to participate in an educational intervention that benefited their children.

This article hence proposes an alternative approach to being a responsibility-sensitive egalitarian: one grounded on our valuable social practices of responsibility, rather than on a desire to mitigate the influence of luck on people's prospects. First, I argue that this practice-based approach better captures the very reasons that responsibility is significant for justice than does the prevalent approach among luck egalitarians: namely, the values of fairness, choice and respect. Second, I show that the remaining motivation of the luck egalitarian approach, of being ‘anti-luck', is impoverished. I conclude by suggesting that this practice-based approach is better motivated and more palatable than existing forms of luck egalitarianism, even for those relational egalitarians who standardly criticise making egalitarianism responsibility-sensitive.},

Through the lens of overweight, I examine health citizenship in the context of universal health provision funded from general taxation, and track attitudes toward “overweight” once its health implications and medical costs affected a public service as well as individual bodies and households. Looking at professional and popular discourses of overweight and obesity, I map the persistence of a highly individual culture of dietary and weight self-management in postwar Britain, and assess the degree to which it was challenged by a new measure of “obesity” – the body mass index – and by visions of an NHS burdened and even threatened by the increasing overweight of the citizens it was created to serve.},

abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly exhorted to ensure their research has policy 'impact', most notably via Research Excellence Framework (REF) impact case studies, and 'pathways to impact' statements in UK Research Council funding applications. Yet the assumptions underpinning these frameworks often fail to reflect available evidence and theories. Notions of 'impact', 'engagement' and 'knowledge exchange' are typically premised on simplistic, linear models of the policy process, according to which policy-makers are keen to 'utilise' expertise to produce more 'effective' policies. Such accounts overlook the rich body of literature in political science, policy studies, and sociology of knowledge, which offer more complex and nuanced accounts. Drawing on this wider literature, this paper sets out four different approaches to theorising the relationship: (1) knowledge shapes policy; (2) politics shapes knowledge; (3) co-production; and (4) autonomous spheres. We consider what each of these four approaches suggests about approaches to incentivising and measuring research impact.},

abstract = {The concept of compulsion, in which addictive behaviour is said to be carried out against the will, is central to the disease theory of addiction and ubiquitous in modern definitions. The aims of this article are: (i) to describe various meanings of compulsion in the literature; (ii) to compare the part thought to be played by compulsion in addiction with its suggested role in obsessive-compulsive disorder; (iii) to critically examine the place of compulsion in influential neurobiological accounts of addiction; (iv) to summarise the empirical evidence bearing on the usefulness of the compulsion concept, evidence that seems at first sight incompatible with the notion of compulsion. This is followed by a discussion of which possible meanings of compulsion can survive an empirical test and what role they might play in understanding addiction, paying particular attention to a distinction between strong and weak senses of compulsion. A conclusion is that addictive behaviour cannot be considered compulsive at the time it is carried out, though other possible meanings of compulsion as an explanation or description of addictive behaviour and experience are discussed. Among other conclusions, it is suggested that, although in some senses of the term it may seem arbitrary whether or not ‘compulsion' should be retained, its use has important consequences for the public understanding of addiction, and is likely to deter people's attempts to overcome their addictions and their chances of success.},

@article{Lake2012,
abstract = {Background: In recent years, alongside the exponential increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, there has been a change in the food environment (foodscape). This research focuses on methods used to measure and classify the foodscape. This paper describes the foodscape across urban/rural and socio-economic divides. It examines the validity of a database of food outlets obtained from Local Authority sources (secondary level {\&} desk based), across urban/rural and socio-economic divides by conducting fieldwork (ground-truthing). Additionally this paper tests the efficacy of using a desk based classification system to describe food outlets, compared with ground-truthing.Methods: Six geographically defined study areas were purposively selected within North East England consisting of two Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs; a small administrative geography) each. Lists of food outlets were obtained from relevant Local Authorities (secondary level {\&} desk based) and fieldwork (ground-truthing) was conducted. Food outlets were classified using an existing tool. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore validation of secondary data sources. Agreement between 'desk' and 'field' based classifications of food outlets were assessed.Results: There were 438 food outlets within all study areas; the urban low socio-economic status (SES) area had the highest number of total outlets (n = 210) and the rural high SES area had the least (n = 19). Differences in the types of outlets across areas were observed. Comparing the Local Authority list to fieldwork across the geographical areas resulted in a range of PPV values obtained; with the highest in urban low SES areas (87{\%}) and the lowest in Rural mixed SES (79{\%}). While sensitivity ranged from 95{\%} in the rural mixed SES area to 60{\%} in the rural low SES area. There were no significant associations between field/desk percentage agreements across any of the divides.Conclusion: Despite the relatively small number of areas, this work furthers our understanding of the validity of using secondary data sources to identify and classify the foodscape in a variety of geographical settings. While classification of the foodscape using secondary Local Authority food outlet data with information obtained from the internet, is not without its difficulties, desk based classification would be an acceptable alternative to fieldwork, although it should be used with caution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lake et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We show that official government household survey data indicate that levels of calorie consumption have declined in England between 1980 and 2013; while there has been an increase in calories from food eaten out at restaurants, fast food, soft drinks and confectionery, overall there has been a decrease in total calories purchased. Households have shifted towards more expensive calories, both by substituting away from home production towards market production, and substituting towards higher quality foods. We show that the decline in calories can be partially, but not entirely, rationalized with weight gain by a decline in the strenuousness of work and daily life. (JEL: D12, I12, I18).},

The taxation of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) in particular is noted to be an effective measure, and SSBs taxes have already been implemented in several countries worldwide. However, although the evidence base suggests that this will be effective in helping to combat rising obesity rates, opponents of SSBs taxation argue that it is illiberal and paternalistic, and therefore should be avoided. Bioethical analysis may play an essential role in clarifying whether policymakers should adopt SSBs taxes as part of wider obesity strategy. In this article we argue that no single ethical theory can account for the complexities inherent in obesity prevention strategy, especially the liberal theories relied upon by opponents of SSBs taxation. We contend that a pluralist approach to the ethics of SSBs taxation must be adopted as the only suitable way of accounting for the multiple overlapping, and sometimes, conflicting factors that are relevant to determining the moral acceptability of such an intervention.},

abstract = {Understanding the link between diet, risk of obesity and the underlying socioeconomic circumstances of the individual is useful for health promotion and improvement interventions. In this study, we examined the socioeconomic factors that jointly affect food consumption choices and risk of obesity. We analyse the National Dietary and Nutrition Survey (2000/01) of adults aged 19-64 years living in private households in the UK, using a health production framework. We used information on the complete food history on individuals in the previous week to create eight common food groups. We estimated a system of linear risk of obesity (as measured by Body Mass Index) and eight diet equations with error terms that are correlated across equations for a given individual, but are uncorrelated across individuals, using the seemingly unrelated regression method. Our findings indicate that the socioeconomic factors (e.g. income and education) associated with sources of healthy eating differ. While increasing household purchasing power may be more effective for increasing consumption of healthier foods such as fruit and vegetables, more knowledge and information about healthy eating may be more effective for cutting down on consumption of less healthy foods (e.g. preserves and savoury foods). An understanding of these different healthy eating contexts is essential for the development of effective targeted food based policies aimed at reducing the risk of obesity. Link to Appendix},

Results: A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria, and were reviewed here. Conclusion: Socioeconomic indicators of low socioeconomic position (SEP), including occupational social class of the head-of-household at birth and during childhood, earlier adulthood occupational social class, contemporaneous occupational social class, educational attainment, and area-level deprivation were generally inversely associated with adult obesity risk in the UK. Measures of SEP were more predictive of obesity among women than among men.

abstract = {Stress is associated with obesity, and the neurobiology of stress overlaps significantly with that of appetite and energy regulation. This review will discuss stress, allostasis, the neurobiology of stress and its overlap with neural regulation of appetite, and energy homeostasis. Stress is a key risk factor in the development of addiction and in addiction relapse. High levels of stress changes eating patterns and augments consumption of highly palatable (HP) foods, which in turn increases incentive salience of HP foods and allostatic load. The neurobiological mechanisms by which stress affects reward pathways to potentiate motivation and consumption of HP foods as well as addictive drugs is discussed. With enhanced incentive salience of HP foods and overconsumption of these foods, there are adaptations in stress and reward circuits that promote stress-related and HP food-related motivation as well as concomitant metabolic adaptations, including alterations in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and other hormones related to energy homeostasis. These metabolic changes in turn might also affect dopaminergic activity to influence food motivation and intake of HP foods. An integrative heuristic model is proposed, wherein repeated high levels of stress alter the biology of stress and appetite/energy regulation, with both components directly affecting neural mechanisms contributing to stress-induced and food cue-induced HP food motivation and engagement in overeating of such foods to enhance risk of weight gain and obesity. Future directions in research are identified to increase understanding of the mechanisms by which stress might increase risk of weight gain and obesity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Obesity is a widespread health condition1, likely to be driven by the increased availability of inexpensive high-calorie food2. People vary greatly in their behavioural response to food. Such variation is likely to be driven by behavioural styles3,4, as behaviour accounts for overall food intake5. A prominent hypothesis is that people with obesity respond to rewards similarly to people with addictions such as alcohol abuse or smoking6,7. For instance, perceived overeating or ‘uncontrolled eating' (UE) is the most common obesity-associated personality trait8 and resembles the perceived loss of control seen in drug addiction. Likewise, both obesity and addictive behaviours have similar correlations with broad personality domains3. Here we seek to empirically test whether obesity and UE overlap behaviourally with addiction and psychiatric disorders, collectively referred to as phenotypes. We test for behavioural similarity by linking the personality profiles of each phenotype. NEO Personality Inventory profiles of 28 phenotypes were extracted from 22 studies, encompassing summary statistics from 18,611 unique participants. Obesity had moderate and UE high behavioural similarity with addictions. UE also overlapped behaviourally with most psychiatric phenotypes, whereas obesity was behaviourally similar with mood disorders and certain personality disorders. Facet-based phenotype profiles provided more information than domain-based profiles.},

abstract = {Psychometric methods were used to explore the reliability and criterion validity of self-reported food intake in studies of dietary restraint. In Study 1 the reliabilities over days of daily aggregate intakes and of intakes at meals at particular times of day were assessed in 7 day food dairies by 27 low-BMI females. The sizes of particular meals correlated poorly with each other and with the total of all other meals; daily aggregate intakes also had poor reliability (Cronbach's alpha). Individuals meal sizes were consistent from day to day, with high inter-correlations between meal sizes, high correlations between meals at particular times and the sum of the remainder and high reliabilities. Aggregate intake had moderate criterion validity. Of individual meals, only breakfast achieved criterion validity, but there was a significant cubic component in its relationship with restraint. In Study 2, young male and female participants with various BMIs, completed a food diary on a single day. Again, aggregate daily intake had low reliability. Total intake and breakfast both had criterion validity, dietary restraint correlating negatively with total intake and breakfast size in the whole sample and in females, but there were significant quadratic components in the relationships. In contrast, restraint correlated positively with lunch size in the whole sample and in males. The combination of low reliability of individual meals as estimates of total intake, and the low criterion validity of all meals except breakfast, suggests that it may be inappropriate to study dietary restraint using aggregate self-reported intake measures.

abstract = {Background In March, 2016, the UK Government proposed a tiered levy on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; high tax for drinks with {\textgreater}8 g of sugar per 100 mL, moderate tax for 5–8 g, and no tax for {\textless}5 g). We estimate the effect of possible industry responses to the levy on obesity, diabetes, and dental caries. Methods We modelled three possible industry responses: reformulation to reduce sugar concentration, an increase of product price, and a change of the market share of high-sugar, mid-sugar, and low-sugar drinks. For each response, we defined a better-case and worse-case health scenario. We developed a comparative risk assessment model to estimate the UK health impact of each scenario on prevalence of obesity and incidence of dental caries and type 2 diabetes. The model combined data for sales and consumption of SSBs, disease incidence and prevalence, price elasticity estimates, and estimates of the association between SSB consumption and disease outcomes. We drew the disease association parameters from a meta-analysis of experimental studies (SSBs and weight change), a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (type 2 diabetes), and a prospective cohort study (dental caries). Findings The best modelled scenario for health is SSB reformulation, resulting in a reduction of 144 383 (95{\%} uncertainty interval 5102–306 743; 0{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}) of 15 470 813 adults and children with obesity in the UK, 19 094 (6920–32 678; incidence reduction of 31{\textperiodcentered}1 per 100 000 person-years) fewer incident cases of type 2 diabetes per year, and 269 375 (82 211–470 928; incidence reduction of 4{\textperiodcentered}4 per 1000 person-years) fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually. An increase in the price of SSBs in the better-case scenario would result in 81 594 (3588–182 669; 0{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}) fewer adults and children with obesity, 10 861 (3899–18 964; 17{\textperiodcentered}7) fewer incident cases of diabetes per year, and 149 378 (45 231–262 013; 2{\textperiodcentered}4) fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually. Changes to market share to increase the proportion of low-sugar drinks sold in the better-case scenario would result in 91 042 (4289–204 903; 0{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}) fewer adults and children with diabetes, 1528 (4414–21 785; 19{\textperiodcentered}7) fewer incident cases of diabetes per year, and 172 718 (47 919–294 499; 2{\textperiodcentered}8) fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually. The greatest benefit for obesity and oral health would be among individuals aged younger than 18 years, with people aged older than 65 years having the largest absolute decreases in diabetes incidence. Interpretation The health impact of the soft drinks levy is dependent on its implementation by industry. Uncertainty exists as to how industry will react and about estimation of health outcomes. Health gains could be maximised by substantial product reformulation, with additional benefits possible if the levy is passed on to purchasers through raising of the price of high-sugar and mid-sugar drinks and activities to increase the market share of low-sugar products.

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past {\~{}}50 years, reaching pandemic levels. Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies — both at the individual and population level — have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of past and current night shift work and genetic type 2 diabetes vulnerability on type 2 diabetes odds. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In the UK Biobank, we examined associations of current (N = 272,214) and lifetime (N = 70,480) night shift work exposure with type 2 diabetes risk (6,770 and 1,191 prevalent cases, respectively). For 180,704 and 44,141 unrelated participants of European ancestry (4,002 and 726 cases, respectively)with genetic data,we assessed whether shift work exposure modified the relationship between a genetic risk score (comprising 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) for type 2 diabetes and prevalent diabetes. RESULTS Compared with day workers, all current night shift workerswere at highermultivariable- A djusted odds for type 2 diabetes (none or rare night shifts: Odds ratio [OR] 1.15 [95{\%} CI 1.05-1.26]; some nights: OR 1.18 [95{\%} CI 1.05-1.32]; and usual nights: OR 1.44 [95{\%}CI 1.19-1.73]), except current permanent night shiftworkers (OR 1.09 [95{\%} CI 0.93-1.27]). Considering a person's lifetime work schedule and compared with never shift workers, workingmore night shifts permonthwas associatedwith higher type 2 diabetes odds ({\textless}3/month: OR 1.24 [95{\%} CI 0.90-1.68]; ≤3/month: OR 1.11 [95{\%} CI 0.90-1.37]; and {\textgreater}8/month: OR 1.36 [95{\%} CI 1.14-1.62]; Ptrend = 0.001). The association between genetic type 2 diabetes predisposition and type 2 diabetes odds was not modified by shift work exposure. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that night shift work, especially rotating shiftwork incluDing night shifts, is associated with higher type 2 diabetes odds and that the number of night shifts worked per month appears most relevant for type 2 diabetes odds. Also, shift work exposure does not modify genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, a novel finDing that warrants replication.},

abstract = {Allocating health care resources based on personal responsibility is a prominent and controversial idea. This article assesses the plausibility of such measures through the lens of luck egalitarianism, a prominent responsibility-sensitive theory of distributive justice. This article presents a framework of luck egalitarianism in health, which integrates other concerns of justice than health, is pluralist, and is compatible with a wide range of measures for giving lower priority to those deemed responsible. Applying this framework to oral health, the allocation of livers among potential transplant recipients and travel insurance demonstrates that this version of luck egalitarianism is a much more attractive and flexible theory than much of the contemporary discussion allows. This also pertains to its ability to provide plausible answers to two prominent critiques of harshness and intrusiveness. The discussion also shows that the luck egalitarian commitment to eliminating the influence of luck on people's lives is likely to require substantial redistribution.},

abstract = {Introduction: Researchers and policy-makers are interested in the influence that food retailing around schools may have on child obesity risk. Most previous research comes from North America, uses data aggregated at the school-level and focuses on associations between fast food outlets and school obesity rates. This study examines associations between food retailing and BMI among a large sample of primary school students in Berkshire, England. By controlling for individual, school and home characteristics and stratifying results across the primary school years, we aimed to identify if the food environment around schools had an effect on BMI, independent of socio-economic variables. Methods: We measured the densities of fast food outlets and food stores found within schoolchildren's home and school environments using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data from local councils. We linked these data to measures from the 2010/11 National Child Measurement Programme and used a cross-classified multi-level approach to examine associations between food retailing and BMI z-scores. Analyses were stratified among Reception (aged 4-5) and Year 6 (aged 10-11) students to measure associations across the primary school years. Results: Our multilevel model had three levels to account for individual (n = 16,956), home neighbourhood (n = 664) and school (n = 268) factors. After controlling for confounders, there were no significant associations between retailing near schools and student BMI, but significant positive associations between fast food outlets in home neighbourhood and BMI z-scores. Year 6 students living in areas with the highest density of fast food outlets had an average BMI z-score that was 0.12 (95{\%}CI: 0.04, 0.20) higher than those living in areas with none. Discussion: We found little evidence to suggest that food retailing around schools influences student BMI. There is some evidence to suggest that fast food outlet densities in a child's home neighbourhood may have an effect on BMI, particularly among girls, but more research is needed to inform effective policies targeting the effects of the retail environment on child obesity.},

abstract = {Mill's Liberty Principle aims to protect ‘social' freedom, which is traditionally understood as negative freedom. I argue that Mill's conception of social freedom does not comfortably fit even a moralized conception of negative freedom, and that individuality, an ideal fundamental to On Liberty, is a robustly positive type of freedom. This raises the question of whether protecting social freedom involves an egalitarian, progressive (in the contemporary sense) state that ambitiously strives to create the social conditions of individuality. I consider the case for an affirmative answer to that question, then argue that the ideal of individuality itself blocks interventions that some contemporary egalitarian, progressive liberals consider at least consistent with the Liberty Principle. These include autonomy-enhancing paternalism, and outright prohibition of as opposed to time, place, and manner regulation of the expression of some opinions that adversely affect protected minorities. Though not libertarian, the Liberty Principle is not an expression of this type of egalitarian liberalism, as evidenced inter alia by Mill's emphatic rejection of state control of education, and his categorical case against prohibiting the expression of even the most extreme and insidious opinions.},

Methods Patients with CAD (N = 151) underwent acute mental stress tasks in conjunction with high-resolution positron emission tomography and radiolabeled water imaging of the brain. Brain responses to mental stress were correlated with waist circumference. Results Waist circumference was positively correlated with increased activation in the right and left frontal lobes ($\beta$ values ranging from 2.81 to 3.75 in the paracentral, medial, and superior gyri), left temporal lobe, left hippocampal, left amygdala, left uncus, and left anterior and posterior cingulate gyri ($\beta$ values ranging from 2.93 to 3.55). Waist circumference was also negatively associated with the left and right parietal lobes, right superior temporal gyrus, and right insula and precuneus ($\beta$ values ranging from 2.82 to 5.20). Conclusion Increased brain activation in the brain regions involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system during psychological stress may underlie stress-induced overeating and abdominal obesity in patients with CAD.},

abstract = {Heritability, genetic correlation, and genetic associations estimated from samples of unrelated individuals are often perceived as confirmation that genotype causes the phenotype(s). However, these estimates can arise from indirect mechanisms due to population phenomena including population stratification, dynastic effects, and assortative mating. We introduce these, describe how they can bias or inflate genotype-phenotype associations, and demonstrate methods that can be used to assess their presence. Using data on educational achievement and parental socioeconomic position as an exemplar, we demonstrate that both heritability and genetic correlation may be biased estimates of the causal contribution of genotype. These results highlight the limitations of genotype-phenotype estimates obtained from samples of unrelated individuals. Use of these methods in combination with family-based designs may offer researchers greater opportunities to explore the mechanisms driving genotype-phenotype associations and identify factors underlying bias in estimates.},

@article{Tomiyama2019,
abstract = {Many pathways connect stress and obesity, two highly prevalent problems facing society today. First, stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second, stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third, stress triggers physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reward processing in the brain, and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally, stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes, ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.},

abstract = {In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize and assess whether short sleep duration is associated with appetite-regulating hormones and adipokine levels. Reference databases were searched for studies related to sleep and appetite-regulating hormones and adipokines. Qualitative and quantitative syntheses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and the level of appetite-regulating hormones and adipokines, including leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, and orexin. Twenty-one of 3536 studies, covering a total of 2250 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin were included in the meta-analysis. Ghrelin levels were higher in the short sleep group (standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.14, 95{\%} CI [0.03, 0.25], p = 0.01). Significant differences between the short sleep group and recommended sleep group were also noted in leptin level experimental subgroup studies (SMD = 0.19, 95{\%} CI [0.03, 0.35], p = 0.02) and ghrelin level cross-sectional subgroup studies (SMD = 0.14, 95{\%} CI [0.02, 0.27], p = 0.03). A rise in leptin and ghrelin levels were also observed in sleep deprivation groups (SMD = 0.24, 95{\%} CI [0.10, 0.39], p = 0.001 and SMD = 0.18, 95{\%} CI [0.04, 0.33], p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, short sleep duration is associated with an increased ghrelin level, while sleep deprivation had a significant effect on the levels of both leptin and ghrelin.},

abstract = {Discussions of civil society are not new. The issues have been contested within political philosophy, sociology and social theory for hundreds of years. Classical debates around civil society had the issue of evidence and knowledge at their heart. For leading thinkers, from Aristotle, Hobbes and Locke through to Rousseau, Tocqueville and Gellner, civil society has been a core of social theory for centuries. The emphasis on knowledge has largely been lost in current discussions. What is new is the increasing emphasis on the concept over the last decade: ‘civil society' has become a buzzword within international development. This is not surprising, since the sector has seen unprecedented growth. CSOs in Ghana, Zimbabwe and Kenya now provide 40{\%} of all healthcare and education; networks such as Sarvodaya in Sri Lanka provide services to 7,000 villages (Edwards, 2004). Bolivia saw the number of registered NGOs rise from 100 in 1980 to over 1,000 in 1999 (Kohl, 2002). It is said that NGOs reach 15–20{\%} of the world's poor (Fowler, 2000). Development NGOs have an annual global budget of some US{\$}5.5bn. Unsurprisingly, they have attracted increasing policy and research attention. There has been a great deal of literature on civil society in international development over the last decade. However, there is remarkably little systematic work on the role and use of evidence as CSOs attempt to influence policy processes. Does evidence matter to CSO work? If so, how, when and why? Can use of evidence improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of CSOs? This paper attempts to respond to these questions by bringing literature on the use of evidence in policymaking together with that on civil society organisations in international development.},

abstract = {This paper gives an account of the development and testing of a nutrition education program aimed at low-income families in the United Kingdom (U.K.), named locally "Friends with Food" (FWF). The study, a demonstration project, implemented in an urban area of a town in the North of England, was subject to extensive evaluation. It was modelled after the largest nutrition education program for low-income people in North America, the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). EFNEP aims to assist low-income families to acquire the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to adopt nutritionally sound diets, thus contributing to dietary improvements for the family. Like EFNEP, guided "hands-on" food preparation and cooking sessions were complemented by formal information. Allowing participants to acquire both the knowledge and skills needed to translate theoretical nutrition messages into practice was shown to be effective. Results suggest that a significant measure of success, in terms of improving nutrition knowledge and self-reported changes in dietary behavior, is possible using this approach. Considerable difficulties are imposed, however, by the lifestyle and financial constraints of people with limited income. Cooperation of partners and family are critical to success, as are the skills of the nutrition educator. Programs aimed at more than just the dissemination of nutrition information are, however, relatively labour intensive, and the authors recommend that the use of nonprofessionals similar in background to clients (paraprofessionals), as exemplified by EFNEP, is worthy of further investigation in the U.K.},

SSB tax evaluations from any formal jurisdiction from cities to national governments were eligible if there was a comparison between pre–post tax (n = 11) or taxed and untaxed jurisdiction(s) (n = 6). The consumption outcome comprised sales, purchasing, and intake (reported by volume, energy, or frequency). Taxed and untaxed beverage consumption outcomes were examined separately by meta-analysis with adjustment for the size of each tax. The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42018100620). The equivalent of a 10{\%} SSB tax was associated with an average decline in beverage purchases and dietary intake of 10.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: −5.0{\%} to −14.7{\%}, n = 17 studies, 6 jurisdictions) with considerable heterogeneity between results (I2 = 97{\%}).The equivalent of a 10{\%} SSB tax was also associated with a nonsignificant 1.9{\%} increase in total untaxed beverage consumption (eg, water) (95{\%} CI: −2.1{\%} to 6.1{\%}, n = 6 studies, 4 jurisdictions). Based on real-world evaluations, SSB taxes introduced in jurisdictions around the world appear to have been effective in reducing SSB purchases and dietary intake.},

The first goal is to "eradicate extreme poverty and hunger." Our greatest responsibility as nutrition professionals is to understand the ramifications of poverty, chronic hunger, and food insecurity. Food insecurity is complex, and the paradox is that not only can it lead to undernutrition and recurring hunger, but also to overnutrition, which can lead to overweight and obesity. It is estimated that by the year 2015 noncommunicable diseases associated with overnutrition will surpass undernutrition as the leading causes of death in low-income communities. Therefore, we need to take heed of the double burden of malnutrition caused by poverty, hunger, and food insecurity. Informing current practitioners, educators, and policymakers and passing this information on to future generations of nutrition students is of paramount importance. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Dietetic Association.},

abstract = {'Stress' embraces the reaction to a multitude of poorly defined factors that disturb homeostasis or allostasis. In this overview, the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system have been utilized as objective measurements of stress reactions. Although long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system is followed by primary hypertension, consequences of similar activation of the HPA axis have not been clearly defined. The focus of this overview is to examine whether or not repeated activation of these two stress centres may be involved in the pathogenesis of abdominal obesity and its comorbidities. In population studies adrenal hormones show strong statistical associations to centralization of body fat as well as to obesity. There is considerable evidence from clinical to cellular and molecular studies that elevated cortisol, particularly when combined with secondary inhibition of sex steroids and growth hormone secretions, is causing accumulation of fat in visceral adipose tissues as well as metabolic abnormalities (The Metabolic Syndrome). Hypertension is probably due to a parallel activation of the central sympathetic nervous system. Depression and 'the small baby syndrome' as well as stress exposure in men and non-human primates are followed with time by similar central and peripheral abnormalities. Glucocorticoid exposure is also followed by increased food intake and 'leptin resistant' obesity, perhaps disrupting the balance between leptin and neuropeptide Y to the advantage of the latter. The consequence might be 'stress-eating', which, however, is a poorly defined entity. Factors activating the stress centres in humans include psychosocial and socioeconomic handicaps, depressive and anxiety traits, alcohol and smoking, with some differences in profile between personalities and genders. Polymorphisms have been defined in several genes associated with the cascade of events along the stress axes. Based on this evidence it is suggested that environmental, perinatal and genetic factors induce neuroendocrine perturbations followed by abdominal obesity with its associated comorbidities. {\textcopyright} 2001 The International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract = {This paper examines how and why health has become a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy for the global food and drink industry (FDI) in the context of current governmental and public calls to address mounting obesity rates. It argues that, despite the current prominence of health within CSR, there has not been a reciprocal interest by those adopting sociological approaches to the study of health and illness in the implications of this strategic uptake of health or in the viability and legitimacy of the state's own public health role. This omission is addressed through an empirical exploration of three contentions: first, that health and wellbeing may be used to secure brand value and consumer goodwill at a time when mounting obesity rates demand new levels of accountability from the FDI. Secondly, that the food industry, through CSR, may promote a narrow epidemiological understanding of obesity, shifting blame from 'foods' to 'diet' and from 'diet' to 'sedentarism'. Thirdly, that CSR reporting and its associated practices have enabled the food industry to assume some responsibility for obesity prevention, thereby problematising the state's role in addressing its own 'public health' crisis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Foundation for the Sociology of Health {\&} Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Number of obese people in Europe has increased threefold over the last 20 years. The paradox of obesity and poverty relationship is observed especially in the developed and developing countries. In developing countries, along with economic development and income growth, the number of people with overweight and obesity is increasing. This paradox has a relationship with both the easy availability and low cost of highly processed foods containing ‘empty calories' and no nutritional value. To date, this paradox has been described in the United States and the United Kingdom, although many European countries are also experiencing high percentages of obese people. Among the reasons for the growing obesity in the population of poor people are: higher unemployment, lower education level, and irregular meals. Another cause of obesity is low physical activity, which among the poor is associated with a lack of money for sports equipment. Due to the large rate of deaths caused by diseases directly linked to obesity, the governments of many countries implement prevention programmes of overweight and obesity. These programmes are based primarily on educating the public about a healthy lifestyle based on healthy eating, daily physical activity and avoiding alcohol and cigarettes.},

There are two points of view; one is the point of a human nature or man as individual and the second is the point of a human society. The main purpose of our article is to answer the question which of these concepts is more suitable from the human nature or human society point of view. Berlin's conclusion is that the negative liberty more reflects the human nature and is a truer human ideal than the positive concept of liberty with the goals of those who seek after a better society. But contrary to Berlin we want to prove that this result is not so evident because each one of these concepts implicitly contains some problematic difficulties which cannot be so simply overcome by Berlin's dichotomy. For this reason the result of our analysis is a scale of liberty between its two poles.},

abstract = {Context: Environmental, policy, and societal changes are important contributors to the rapid rise in obesity over the past few decades, and there has been substantial progress toward identifying environmental and policy factors related to eating and physical activity that can point toward solutions. This article is a status report on research on physical activity and food environments, and it suggests how these findings can be used to improve diet and physical activity and to control or reduce obesity. Methods: This article summarizes and synthesizes recent reviews and provides examples of representative studies. It also describes ongoing innovative interventions and policy change efforts that were identified through conference presentations, media coverage, and websites. Findings: Numerous cross-sectional studies have consistently demonstrated that some attributes of built and food environments are associated with physical activity, healthful eating, and obesity. Residents of walkable neighborhoods who have good access to recreation facilities are more likely to be physically active and less likely to be overweight or obese. Residents of communities with ready access to healthy foods also tend to have more healthful diets. Disparities in environments and policies that disadvantage low-income communities and racial minorities have been documented as well. Evidence from multilevel studies, prospective research, and quasi-experimental evaluations of environmental changes are just beginning to emerge. Conclusions: Environment, policy, and multilevel strategies for improving diet, physical activity, and obesity control are recommended based on a rapidly growing body of research and the collective wisdom of leading expert organizations. A public health imperative to identify and implement solutions to the obesity epidemic warrants the use of the most promising strategies while continuing to build the evidence base. {\textcopyright} 2009 Milbank Memorial Fund.},

This study demonstrated that 8- to 10-year-old, low-income, rural children (N = 287) confront a wider array of multiple physical (substandard housing, noise, crowding) and psychosocial (family turmoil, early childhood separation, community violence) Stressors than do their middle-income counterparts. Prior research on self-reported distress among inner-city minority children is replicated and extended among low-income, rural White children with evidence of higher levels of self- and parent-reported psychological distress, greater difficulties in self-regulatory behavior (delayed gratification), and elevated psychophysiological stress (resting blood pressure, overnight neuroendocrine hormones).

abstract = {To date, there are few known predictors of stress-induced eating. The purpose of this study was to identify whether physiological and psychological variables are related to eating after stress. Specifically, we hypothesized that high cortisol reactivity in response to stress may lead to eating after stress, given the relations between cortisol with both psychological stress and mechanisms affecting hunger. To test this, we exposed fifty-nine healthy pre-menopausal women to both a stress session and a control session on different days. High cortisol reactors consumed more calories on the stress day compared to low reactors, but ate similar amounts on the control day. In terms of taste preferences, high reactors ate significantly more sweet food across days. Increases in negative mood in response to the stressors were also significantly related to greater food consumption. These results suggest that psychophysiological response to stress may influence subsequent eating behavior. Over time, these alterations could impact both weight and health.

Major themes were identified in the literature, and extensive overlap was identified between several of the themes. Ethics sub-themes related primarily to individual responsibility and included: (i) personal control, will power, and choice; and (ii) blame and weight bias. Stigma sub-themes included: (i) the impact on self-stigma and stigma from others, (ii) the differential impact of substance use disorder versus behavioral addiction on stigma, and (iii) the additive stigma of addiction plus obesity and/or eating disorder. Policy implications were broadly derived from comparisons to the tobacco industry and focused on addictive foods as opposed to food addiction. This scoping review underscored the need for increased awareness of food addiction and the role of the food industry, empirical research to identify specific hyperpalatable food substances, and policy interventions that are not simply extrapolated from tobacco.},

At the domain level, BMI had a positive association with Neuroticism and a negative association with Conscientiousness domains. At the facet level, we found associations between BMI and 15 facets from all five personality domains, with only some Neuroticism and Conscientiousness facets among them. Certain personality-BMI associations were moderated by sample properties, such as proportions of women or participants with obesity; these moderation effects were replicated in the individual-level analysis. Finally, facet-based personality “risk” scores accounted for 2.3{\%} of variance in BMI in a separate sample of individuals (N = 3569), 409{\%} more than domain-based scores. Taken together, personality-BMI associations are facet specific, and delineating them may help to explain obesity-related behaviours and inform intervention designs.

Study Selection: Publications linking food prices, dietary quality, and socioeconomic status were selected. Data Extraction: Where possible, review conclusions were illustrated using a French national database of commonly consumed foods and their mean retail prices. Data Synthesis: Foods of lower nutritional value and lower-quality diets generally cost less per calorie and tended to be selected by groups of lower socioeconomic status. A number of nutrient-dense foods were available at low cost but were not always palatable or culturally acceptable to the low-income consumer. Acceptable healthier diets were uniformly associated with higher costs. Food budgets in poverty were insufficient to ensure optimum diets. Conclusions: Socioeconomic disparities in diet quality may be explained by the higher cost of healthy diets. Identifying food patterns that are nutrient rich, affordable, and appealing should be a priority to fight social inequalities in nutrition and health.},

We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries. Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories ({\textless}18.5 kg/m2[underweight], 18.5 kg/m2to {\textless}20 kg/m2, 20 kg/m2to {\textless}25 kg/m2, 25 kg/m2to {\textless}30 kg/m2, 30 kg/m2to {\textless}35 kg/m2, 35 kg/m2to {\textless}40 kg/m2, ≥40 kg/m2[morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue. Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19.2 million adult participants (9.9 million men and 9.3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21.7 kg/m2(95{\%} credible interval 21.3-22.1) in 1975 to 24.2 kg/m2(24.0-24.4) in 2014 in men, and from 22.1 kg/m2(21.7-22.5) in 1975 to 24.4 kg/m2(24.2-24.6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21.4 kg/m2in central Africa and south Asia to 29.2 kg/m2(28.6-29.8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21.8 kg/m2(21.4-22.3) in south Asia to 32.2 kg/m2(31.5-32.8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13.8{\%} (10.5-17.4) to 8.8{\%} (7.4-10.3) in men and from 14.6{\%} (11.6-17.9) to 9.7{\%} (8.3-11.1) in women.

Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3.2{\%} (2.4-4.1) in 1975 to 10.8{\%} (9.7-12.0) in 2014 in men, and from 6.4{\%} (5.1-7.8) to 14.9{\%} (13.6-16.1) in women. 2.3{\%} (2.0-2.7) of the world's men and 5.0{\%} (4.4-5.6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI ≥35 kg/m2). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0.64{\%} (0.46-0.86) in men and 1.6{\%} (1.3-1.9) in women. Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18{\%} in men and surpass 21{\%} in women; severe obesity will surpass 6{\%} in men and 9{\%} in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world's poorest regions, especially in south Asia.},

abstract = {This article examines health promotion and disease prevention from the perspective of social cognitive theory. This theory posits a multifaceted causal structure in which self-efficacy beliefs operate together with goals, outcome expectations, and perceived environmental impediments and facilitators in the regulation of human motivation, behavior, and well-being. Belief in one's efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change - whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved. Human health is a social matter, not just an individual one. A comprehensive approach to health promotion also requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread effects on human health.},

abstract = {Despite growing attention to the problem of obesogenic environments, there has not been a comprehensive review evaluating the food environment-diet relationship. This study aims to evaluate this relationship in the current literature, focusing specifically on the method of exposure assessment (GIS, survey, or store audit). This study also explores 5 dimensions of "food access" (availability, accessibility, affordability, accommodation, acceptability) using a conceptual definition proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981). Articles were retrieved through a systematic keyword search in Web of Science and supplemented by the reference lists of included studies. Thirty-eight studies were reviewed and categorized by the exposure assessment method and the conceptual dimensions of access it captured. GIS-based measures were the most common measures, but were less consistently associated with diet than other measures. Few studies examined dimensions of affordability, accommodation, and acceptability. Because GIS-based measures on their own may not capture important non-geographic dimensions of access, a set of recommendations for future researchers is outlined. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Evans2007,
abstract = {A massive literature documents the inverse association between poverty or low socioeconomic status and health, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this robust relation. We examined longitudinal relations between duration of poverty exposure since birth, cumulative risk exposure, and physiological stress in two hundred seven 13-year-olds. Chronic stress was assessed by basal blood pressure and overnight cortisol levels; stress regulation was assessed by cardiovascular reactivity to a standard acute stressor and recovery after exposure to this stressor. Cumulative risk exposure was measured by multiple physical (e.g., substandard housing) and social (e.g., family turmoil) risk factors. The greater the number of years spent living in poverty, the more elevated was overnight cortisol and the more dysregulated was the cardiovascular response (i.e., muted reactivity). Cardiovascular recovery was not affected by duration of poverty exposure. Unlike the duration of poverty exposure, concurrent poverty (i.e., during adolescence) did not affect these physiological stress outcomes. The effects of childhood poverty on stress dysregulation are largely explained by cumulative risk exposure accompanying childhood poverty. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 Association for Psychological Science.},

@article{Klohe-Lehman2006,
abstract = {Objective: To examine if greater nutrition knowledge vs gains in knowledge promote more successful weight loss in low-income, overweight and obese mothers with young children. Design: A convenience sample of mothers and their children were measured for height and weight; mothers completed demographic and nutrition knowledge questionnaires pre- and postintervention. Subjects/setting: Participants (N=141) were recruited from government and public health clinics and elementary schools. Inclusion criteria for mothers were: family income {\textless}200{\%} federal poverty level; overweight/obese; and Hispanic, African-American, or white race/ethnicity. Intervention: Eight weekly weight-loss classes emphasizing diet, physical activity, and behavior modification based on Social Cognitive Theory were administered to mothers. Main outcome measures: Improvements in maternal nutrition knowledge and weight loss. Statistical analyses performed: Paired-samples t tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, Pearson correlations, and $\chi$2 statistics. Results: Nutrition knowledge of mothers increased in all areas. Participants with weight loss {\textless}2.27 kg (responders) had greater knowledge than those who did not; however, the actual net gain was similar for those who lost and did not lose weight. Weight gainers only improved in two areas on the test, whereas weight-loss responders increased knowledge in all six. Responders appeared more cognizant of diet, weight loss, and health information. Conclusions: Weight-management programs should include a strong component of nutrition education to alleviate knowledge inequalities and promote more effective weight control. In low-income mothers, greater initial knowledge may be more predictive of weight loss than gains in knowledge during an intervention.

@article{Drewnowski2005,
abstract = {Highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States are found among the lower-income groups. The observed links between obesity and socioeconomic position may be related to dietary energy density and energy cost. Refined grains, added sugars, and added fats are among the lowest-cost sources of dietary energy. They are inexpensive, good tasting, and convenient. In contrast, the more nutrient-dense lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit generally cost more. An inverse relationship between energy density of foods (kilojoules per gram) and their energy cost (dollars per megajoule) means that the more energy-dense diets are associated with lower daily food consumption costs and may be an effective way to save money. However, economic decisions affecting food choice may have physiologic consequences. Laboratory studies suggest that energy-dense foods and energy-dense diets have a lower satiating power and may result in passive overeating and therefore weight gain. Epidemiologic analyses suggest that the low-cost energy-dense diets also tend to be nutrient poor. If the rise in obesity rates is related to the growing price disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods, then the current strategies for obesity prevention may need to be revised. Encouraging low-income families to consume healthier but more costly foods to prevent future disease can be construed as an elitist approach to public health. Limiting access to inexpensive foods through taxes on frowned upon fats and sweets is a regressive measure. The broader problem may lie with growing disparities in incomes and wealth, declining value of the minimum wage, food imports, tariffs, and trade. Evidence is emerging that obesity in America is a largely economic issue.},

abstract = {In addition to short sleep duration, reduced sleep quality is also associated with appetite control. The present study examined the effect of sleep fragmentation, independent of sleep duration, on appetite profiles and 24{\^{A}} h profiles of hormones involved in energy balance regulation. A total of twelve healthy male subjects (age 23 (sd 4) years, BMI 24{\textperiodcentered}4 (sd 1{\textperiodcentered}9){\^{A}} kg/m2) completed a 24{\^{A}} h randomised crossover study in which sleep (23.30-07.30 hours) was either fragmented or non-fragmented. Polysomnography was used to determine rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and total sleep time (TST). Blood samples were taken at baseline and continued hourly for the 24{\^{A}} h period to measure glucose, insulin, ghrelin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and melatonin concentrations. In addition, salivary cortisol levels were measured. Visual analogue scales were used to score appetite-related feelings. Sleep fragmentation resulted in reduced REM sleep (69{\textperiodcentered}4{\^{A}} min compared with 83{\textperiodcentered}5{\^{A}} min; P{\textless}{\^{A}} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) and preservation of SWS without changes in TST. In fragmented v. non-fragmented sleep, glucose concentrations did not change, while insulin secretion was decreased in the morning, and increased in the afternoon (P{\textless}{\^{A}} 0{\textperiodcentered}05), and GLP-1 concentrations and fullness scores were lower (P{\textless}{\^{A}} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). After dinner, desire-to-eat ratings were higher after fragmented sleep (P{\textless}{\^{A}} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). A single night of fragmented sleep, resulting in reduced REM sleep, induced a shift in insulin concentrations, from being lower in the morning and higher in the afternoon, while GLP-1 concentrations and fullness scores were decreased. These results may lead to increased food intake and snacking, thus contributing to a positive energy balance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {Many liberal theories are committed to the promotion of population health, and the principle of non-interference in individual life plans. Public health interventions often bring out a tension between these two values. In this paper, I examine this tension by assessing the justifiability of liberty-restricting policies in the field of obesity prevention. As I want to show, a 'soft' form of paternalism, which interferes with people's choices to safeguard their true interests, goes some way in justifying such policies, but it leaves unaddressed the problem of limiting the liberty of those whose true interest is in pursuing an unhealthy lifestyle. I argue that in this latter case, the key to reconcile the promotion of population health with the respect for individual liberty is distributive justice: when we cannot help those who care about their health without doing the same for those who do not, fairness will often require us to do so.},

In line with a distinguished psychological literature, we consider modes of self- control that involve the self-imposed use of contingent punishments and rewards. We study settings in which consumers with quasi-hyperbolic preferences confront an other- wise standard intertemporal allocation problem with credit constraints. Our main result demonstrates that low initial assets can limit self-control, trapping people in poverty, while individuals with high initial assets can accumulate indefinitely. Thus, even tempo- rary policies that initiate accumulation among the poor may be effective. We examine implications concerning the effect of access to credit on saving, the demand for com- mitment devices, the design of financial accounts to promote accumulation, and the variation of the marginal propensity to consume across income from different sources. We also explore the nature of optimal self-control, demonstrating that it has a simple and behaviorally plausible structure that is immune to self-renegotiation.},

Of 33 traits analysed, 21 showed significant geographic clustering at the genetic level after controlling for ancestry, probably reflecting migration driven by socioeconomic status (SES). Alleles associated with educational attainment (EA) showed the most clustering, with EA-decreasing alleles clustering in lower SES areas such as coal mining areas. Individuals who leave coal mining areas carry more EA-increasing alleles on average than those in the rest of Great Britain. The level of geographic clustering is correlated with genetic associations between complex traits and regional measures of SES, health and cultural outcomes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that social stratification leaves visible marks in geographic arrangements of common allele frequencies and gene–environment correlations.},

abstract = {Healthy People 2010 included an objective to "increase the proportion of ... health professional training schools whose basic curriculum for healthcare providers includes the core competencies in health promotion and disease prevention." Interprofessional prevention education has been seen by the Healthy People Curriculum Task Force as a key strategy for achieving this objective and strengthening prevention content in health professions education programs. To fulfill these aims, the Association for Prevention Teaching and Research sponsored the Institute for Interprofessional Prevention Education in 2007 and in 2008. The institutes were based on the premise that if clinicians from different professions are to function effectively in teams, health professions students need to learn with, from, and about students from other professions. The institutes assembled interprofessional teams of educators from academic health centers across the country and provided instruction in approaches for improving interprofessional prevention education. Interprofessional education also plays a key role in implementation of Healthy People 2020 Education for Health framework. The delivery of preventive services provides a nearly level playing field in which multiple professions each make important contributions. Prevention education should take place during that phase of the educational continuum in which the attitudes, skills, and knowledge necessary for both effective teamwork and prevention are incorporated into the "DNA" of future health professionals. Evaluation of the teams' educational initiatives holds important lessons. These include allowing ample time for planning, obtaining student input during planning, paying explicit attention to teamwork, and taking account of cultural differences across professions. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {Normative thinking about addiction has traditionally been divided between, on the one hand, a medical model which sees addiction as a disease characterized by compulsive and relapsing drug use over which the addict has little or no control and, on the other, a moral model which sees addiction as a choice characterized by voluntary behavior under the control of the addict. Proponents of the former appeal to evidence showing that regular consumption of drugs causes persistent changes in the brain structures and functions known to be involved in the motivation of behavior. On this evidence, it is often concluded that becoming addicted involves a transition from voluntary, chosen drug use to non-voluntary compulsive drug use. Against this view, proponents of the moral model provide ample evidence that addictive drug use involves voluntary chosen behavior. In this article we argue that although they are right about something, both views are mistaken. We present a third model that neither rules out the view of addictive drug use as compulsive, nor that it involves voluntary chosen behavior. {\textcopyright} 2013 Henden, Melberg and R{\o}geberg.},

Each subject was studied twice: during a weight maintenance diet and during ad libitum food intake. Energy metabolism was measured by indirect calorimetry and food intake by an automated food- selection system. Twenty-four-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion (24-h NE) was used as an estimate of sympathetic nervous system activity. During weight maintenance, METH intravenous infusion (125 mg/30 min) increased energy expenditure compared with PLAC, and after 4 days of oral therapy, METH (40 mg/day) decreased 24-h NE and increased energy expenditure compared with PLAC. During ad libitum food intake, after 4 days of METH (40 mg/day) or PLAC oral therapy, both groups increased their energy intake over weight maintenance, but the increase was significantly larger in the METH group compared with the PLAC group (4,554 ± 1,857 vs. 2,867 ± 846 kcal/day; P = 0.04). Our data suggest that therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids induce obesity mostly by increasing energy intake, an effect which may be related to the ability of glucocorticoids to act directly or indirectly on the central regulation of appetite.},

abstract = {Background: The 'deprivation amplification' hypothesis suggests that residents of deprived neighbourhoods have universally poorer access to high-quality food environments, which in turn contributes to the development of spatial inequalities in diet and diet-related chronic disease. This paper presents results from a study that quantified access to grocery stores selling fresh fruit and vegetables in four environmental settings in Scotland, UK. Methods: Spatial accessibility, as measured by network travel times, to 457 grocery stores located in 205 neighbourhoods in four environmental settings (island, rural, small town and urban) in Scotland was calculated using Geographical Information Systems. The distribution of accessibility by neighbourhood deprivation in each of these four settings was investigated. Results: Overall, the most deprived neighbourhoods had the best access to grocery stores and grocery stores selling fresh produce. Stratified analysis by environmental setting suggests that the least deprived compared with the most deprived urban neighbourhoods have greater accessibility to grocery stores than their counterparts in island, rural and small town locations. Access to fresh produce is better in more deprived compared with less deprived urban and small town neighbourhoods, but poorest in the most affluent island communities with mixed results for rural settings. Conclusions: The results presented here suggest that the assumption of a universal 'deprivation amplification' hypothesis in studies of the neighbourhood food environment may be misguided. Associations between neighbourhood deprivation and grocery store accessibility vary by environmental setting. Theories and policies aimed at understanding and rectifying spatial inequalities in the distribution of neighbourhood exposures for poor diet need to be context specific. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009; all rights reserved.

Concerns exist about how industry-sponsored studies in nutrition tend to favour the interest of the sponsor. We describe the scope of partnerships between Coca-Cola and health organizations in Spain, examining marketing strategies contained in scientific papers funded by Coca-Cola. Methods: Funding for health organizations in Spain during 2010-2016 was retrieved of the Coca-Cola transparency list. We systematically searched research projects and publications (by PubMed) of all the recipient organizations. In addition, we characterize the research agenda and the level of alignment of sponsored authors with marketing strategies used by Coca-Cola. Results: A total of 74 health organizations received funding from Coca-Cola between 2010 and 2016. Nutritional and cardiology organizations received the highest financial support. A total of 20 articles derived of two research projects were identified. Most publications (14 out of 20) were aligned with marketing strategies used by Coca-Cola (e.g. focusing on physical inactivity as the main cause of obesity). Authors identified did not disclose having previous conflicts of interest. Conclusion: In Spain, numerous health organizations receive financial support from Coca-Cola. We provide evidence that research funded by this beverage company is serving its commercial objectives that, in many cases, are at odds with efforts to improve population health. Problems with transparency among authors and the recipient organizations imply that we are offering very conservative estimates about the impact of this company on public health.},

abstract = {The present systematic review examined the relationship between nutrition knowledge and dietary intake in adults (mean age ≥{\^{A}} 18 years). Relevant databases were searched from the earliest record until November 2012. Search terms included: nutrition; diet or food knowledge and energy intake; feeding behaviour; diet; eating; nutrient or food intake or consumption. Included studies were original research articles that used instruments providing quantitative assessment of both nutrition knowledge and dietary intake and their statistical association. The initial search netted 1{\^{A}} 193{\^{A}} 393 potentially relevant articles, of which twenty-nine were eligible for inclusion. Most of them were conducted in community populations (n 22) with fewer (n 7) in athletic populations. Due to the heterogeneity of methods used to assess nutrition knowledge and dietary intake, a meta-analysis was not possible. The majority of the studies (65{\textperiodcentered}5{\^{A}} {\%}: community 63{\textperiodcentered}6{\^{A}} {\%}; athletic 71{\textperiodcentered}4{\^{A}} {\%}) reported significant, positive, but weak (r{\textless}{\^{A}} 0{\textperiodcentered}5) associations between higher nutrition knowledge and dietary intake, most often a higher intake of fruit and vegetables. However, study quality ranged widely and participant representation from lower socio-economic status was limited, with most participants being tertiary educated and female. Well-designed studies using validated methodologies are needed to clarify the relationship between nutrition knowledge and dietary intake. Diet quality scores or indices that aim to evaluate compliance to dietary guidelines may be particularly valuable for assessing the relationship between nutrition knowledge and dietary intake. Nutrition knowledge is an integral component of health literacy and as low health literacy is associated with poor health outcomes, contemporary, high-quality research is needed to inform community nutrition education and public health policy. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: Short and/or long sleep duration are associated with cardiometabolic disease risk and may be differentially experienced among minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The present study examined nationally representative data along multiple dimensions of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Survey. Patients or Participants: 2007-2008 NHANES (N = 4,850). Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Self-reported sleep duration was classified as very short ({\textless} 5 h), short (5-6 h), normative (7-8 h) and long (≥ 9 h). Population-weighted multinomial logistic regression analyses examined race/ ethnicity, country of origin, language, income, education, health insurance, and food security, controlling for all others as well as age, sex, marital-status, and overall self-rated health. Outcome was self-reported sleep duration, relative to normative sleep duration. Blacks/African Americans were more likely than whites to report very short (OR = 2.34, P {\textless} 0.001) and short (OR = 1.85, P {\textless} 0.001) sleep. Mexican Americans reported less long sleep (OR = 0.36, P = 0.032). Other Hispanics/ Latinos reported more very short sleep (OR = 2.69, P = 0.025). Asians/ Others reported more very short (OR = 3.99, P = 0.002) and short (OR = 2.08, P = 0.002) sleep. Mexico-born adults reported less short sleep (OR = 0.63, P = 0.042). Spanish-only speakers reported less very short sleep (OR = 0.32, P = 0.030). Lower income groups reported more very short sleep versus {\textgreater} {\$}75,000. Compared to college graduates, increased very short sleep was seen among all lower education levels. Those with public insurance reported more very short (OR = 1.67, P = 0.31) and long (OR = 1.83, P = 0.011) sleep versus uninsured. Very low food security was associated with very short (OR = 1.86, P = 0.036) and short (OR = 1.44, P = 0.047) sleep. Conclusions: Minority status and lower socioeconomic position were associated with shorter self-reported sleep durations.},

abstract = {The distribution of scarce healthcare resources is an increasingly important issue due to factors such as expensive 'high tech' medicine, longer life expectancies and the rising prevalence of chronic illness. Furthermore, in the current healthcare context lifestyle-related factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco use and obesity are believed to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. As such, this paper focuses on an ongoing debate in the academic literature regarding the role of responsibility for illness in healthcare resource allocation: should patients with self-caused illness receive lower priority in access to healthcare resources? This paper critically describes the lower priority debate's 12 key arguments and maps out their relationships. This analysis reveals that most arguments have been refuted and that the debate has stalled and remains unresolved. In conclusion, we suggest progression could be achieved by inviting multidisciplinary input from a range of stakeholders for the development of evidence-based critical evaluations of existing arguments and the development of novel arguments, including the outstanding rebuttals.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess attributions for overweight and the level of support for policy initiatives in Great Britain.
Design: Cross-sectional. Respondents indicated their agreement (5-point scales: strongly disagree to strongly agree) to three potential causes of overweight (environment, genes, willpower) and five policies (free weight-loss treatment, taxing unhealthy foods, healthy lifestyle campaigns, food labelling, advertising restrictions).
Setting: Data were collected as part of a computer-assisted, face-to-face Omnibus survey of adults (aged {\textgreater}15 years) from across Great Britain in April 2012 carried out by a market research company.
Subjects: A population-representative sample of British adults (n 1986).
Results: More people attributed overweight to the food environment (61 {\%}) and lack of willpower (57 {\%}) than to genes (45 {\%}). Policy support was highest for healthy lifestyle campaigns (71 {\%}) and food labelling (66 {\%}), and lowest for taxing unhealthy foods (32 {\%}). Food environment attributions were associated with higher support for all policies (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}001). Genetic attributions were associated with higher support for free weight-loss treatments and healthy lifestyle campaigns (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}001), but not other policies. Attributions to lack of willpower were not associated differentially with support for any policies (P {\textgreater} 0{\textperiodcentered}01).
Conclusions: Belief that overweight is caused by the food environment or genes - both seen as outside individual control - was associated with greater support for government policies to prevent and treat obesity. Improving awareness of the multiple causes of obesity could facilitate acceptance of policy action to reduce obesity prevalence.},

The aim of this study was to project trends in social inequalities in obesity to 2035 in male and female adults (aged 16+) in the UK to ascertain if the gap is widening or narrowing. Methodology: BMI data for the UK were extracted from the Health Survey for England (2004-14), Scottish Health Survey (2008-14) and the Welsh Health Survey (2004-14), respectively. A non-linear multivariate regression model was fitted to cross-sectional risk factor data to create longitudinal projections to 2035 stratified by sex, and occupational status or education level. Results: Individuals in routine and manual jobs are projected to have the highest prevalence of obesity by 2035 and to experience the highest increases in obesity prevalence to 2035. Social inequalities based on occupation are projected to widen (except in English females). Social inequalities based on education are projected to decrease (except in Welsh females). Discussion: A population strategy of prevention focused on the structural determinants of obesity is needed to change the trajectory of obesity prevalence trends and to tackle health inequalities.},

Or is it immoral to blame the victim of sickness? A moral perspective that is sensitive to therapeutic concerns will downplay blame, but banishing all blame is neither feasible nor desirable. We need to understand the ambiguities surrounding moral responsibility in four contexts: (I) preventing sickness, (2) assigning financial liabilities for health care costs, (3) giving meaning to human suffering, and (4) interacting with health care professionals. We also need to distinguish different kinds of blame, explore the interplay of justice and compassion in avoiding unjustified blaming of victims, and work toward a unified moral-therapeutic perspective that encourages individuals to accept responsibility while avoiding destructive forms of blaming. {\textcopyright} 2001 Human Sciences Press, Inc.},

Ten thousand seven hundred thirty-six adolescents (5425 boys) had complete data. Adolescents in the lowest income group were at greatest risk of overweight and obesity. Adolescents living in poverty were more likely to be overweight and obese, and reported more frequent consumption of sweetened drinks and fast food and less frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables (p {\textless} 0.001).

The objective of this study was to investigate whether shiftwork was independently associated with obesity, diabetes, poor sleep, and well-being in a large, UK general population cohort. Methods: Participants of the UK Biobank study who were employed at the time of assessment were included. Exposure variables were self-reported shiftwork (any shiftwork and night shiftwork); and outcomes were objectively measured obesity, inflammation and physical activity and self-reported lifestyle, sleep and well-being variables, including mental health. Results: Shiftwork was reported by 17{\%} of the 277,168 employed participants. Shiftworkers were more likely to be male, socioeconomically deprived and smokers, and to have higher levels of physical activity. Univariately, and following adjustment for lifestyle and work-related confounders, shiftworkers were more likely to be obese, depressed, to report disturbed sleep, and to have neurotic traits. Conclusions: Shiftwork was independently associated with multiple indicators of poor health and wellbeing, despite higher physical activity, and even in shiftworkers that did not work nights. Shiftwork is an emerging social factor that contributes to disease in the urban environment across the working population.Key messages Studies have linked shiftwork to obesity and diabetes in nurses and industry workers, but little is known about the implications of shiftwork for the general workforce In this large cross sectional study of UK workers, shiftwork was associated with obesity, depression and sleep disturbance, despite higher levels of physical activity.

Methods: BMI and waist circumference (WC) were measured in 8,076 participants from three cities. The number of fast-food restaurants, full-service restaurants, bars/pubs, markets, and liquor stores within 500 m of each participant was documented. The association between the food environment (ratio of fast-food to full-service restaurants, ratio of bars/pubs to liquor stores, and presence of markets) with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 102 cm for males or WC ≥ 88 cm for females) was investigated, adjusted for age, sex, education level, neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood type, and total hours per week of walking and taking into account city-level clustering. Results: The ratios of fast-food to full-service restaurants and of bars/pubs to liquor stores were positively associated with obesity (OR = 1.05 [CI: 1.02-1.09] and OR = 1.08 [CI: 1.04-1.13], respectively).

abstract = {Background: Consumers regularly and predictably behave in ways that contradict standard assumptions of economic analysis such that they make decisions that prevent them from reaching rationally intended goals. These contradictions play a significant role with respect to consumers' food decisions and the effect these decisions have on their health. Discussion: Food decisions that are rationally derived include those that trade short-term gains of sensory pleasure (hedonic) for longer term gains of health and wellness (utilitarian). However, extra-rational food decisions are much more common. They can occur because of the contexts in which they are made-such as being distracted or pressed for time. In these contexts, heuristics (or rules of thumb) are used. Because food decisions are made with little cognitive involvement, food policies designed to appeal to highly cognitive thought (e.g., fat taxes, detailed information labels) are likely to have little impact. Furthermore, food marketing environments influence not only what foods consumers buy but also how much. As a general principle, when individuals do not behave in their own interest, markets will feed perverse and sub-optimal behaviors. Conclusion: Given the limited ability of individuals to retain and use accurate health information coupled with varying levels of self control, profit motivations of marketers can become predatory-though not necessarily malicious. Alternative policy options that do not restrict choice are outlined, which enable consumers to make better decisions. These options allow for profit motivations of marketers to align with the long-term well being of the consumer. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the food addiction model and the role of food hedonic pathways in the pathogenesis and treatment of obesity.
RECENT FINDINGS: The hedonic pathway interacts with the obesogenic environment to override homeostatic mechanisms to cause increase in body weight. Weight gain sustained over time leads to "upward setting" of defended level of body-fat mass. There are neurobiological and phenotypic similarities and differences between hedonic pathways triggered by food compared with other addictive substances, and the entity of food addiction remains controversial. Treatment for obesity including pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery impacts on neural pathways governing appetite and hedonic control of food intake. The food addiction model may also have significant impact on public health policy, regulation of certain foods, and weight stigma and bias. Recent rapid progress in delineation of food hedonic pathways advances our understanding of obesity and facilitates development of effective treatment measures against the disease.},

abstract = {Background: Recent epidemiological studies suggest that short sleep duration may be associated with the development of obesity from childhood to adulthood. Objectives: To assess whether the evidence supports the presence of a relationship between short sleep duration and obesity at different ages, and to obtain an estimate of the risk. Methods: We performed a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1996-2007 wk 40), EMBASE (from 1988), AMED (from 1985), CINHAL (from 1982) and PsycINFO (from 1985) and manual searches without language restrictions. When necessary, authors were contacted. Criteria for inclusion were: report of duration of sleep as exposure, BMI as continuous outcome and prevalence of obesity as categorical outcome, number of participants, age, and gender. Results were pooled using a random effect model. Sensitivity analysis was performed, heterogeneity and publication bias were also checked. Results are expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR [95{\%} confidence intervals, CIs]) and as pooled regression coefficients ($\beta$; 95{\%} CIs). Results: Of 696 studies identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria (19 in children and 26 in adults) and 30 (12 and 18, respectively) were pooled in the meta-analysis for a total of 36 population samples. They included 634,511 participants (30,002 children and 604,509 adults) from around the world. Age ranged from 2 to 102 years and included boys, girls, men and women. In children the pooled OR for short duration of sleep and obesity was 1.89 (1.46 to 2.43; P {\textless} 0.0001). In adults the pooled OR was 1.55 (1.43 to 1.68; P {\textless} 0.0001). There was no evidence of publication bias. In adults, the pooled $\beta$ for short sleep duration was -0.35 (-0.57 to -0.12) unit change in BMI per hour of sleep change. Conclusions: Cross-sectional studies from around the world show a consistent increased risk of obesity amongst short sleepers in children and adults. Causal inference is difficult due to lack of control for important confounders and inconsistent evidence of temporal sequence in prospective studies.},

abstract = {Transcutaneous oxygen tension is a useful method with which to assess the functional status of skin blood flow. The reduced values observed in diabetic patients have been interpreted as a consequence of peripheral vascular disease. However, diabetic patients show lower transcutaneous oxygen tension values than control subjects with equivalent degrees of peripheral vascular disease, suggesting that additional factors are involved. Since the autonomic nervous system influences peripheral circulation, we studied the relationship between autonomic neuropathy and foot transcutaneous oxymetry in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients without peripheral vascular disease. The following age-matched patients were selected and evaluated: control subjects, C, (n=20), NIDDM patients without autonomic neuropathy, D, (n=16) and with autonomic neuropathy, DN, (n=20). All diabetic patients showed lower transcutaneous oxygen tension values than control subjects, while no differences were observed between the diabetic patients with and without autonomic neuropathy. In addition the saturation index that increases in the presence of autonomic neuropathy does not correlate with foot Tc PO2. In conclusion autonomic neuropathy does not influence foot Tc PO2 and therefore it is unlikely that it contributes to development of foot lesions during induction of foot skin ischaemia. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background and purpose:Nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and eating self-regulation are important determinants of overweight and obesity. Eating self-regulation is the link between eating intention and behavior. However, the extent to which these factors influence overweight and obesity has not been thoroughly studied. The study examined nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and eating self-regulation as predictors of overweight and obesity among adults in a community setting.Methods:A total of 313 adults participated in an online survey, which included the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire-Revised, the Nutrition Attitudes Questionnaire, and the Self-Regulation of Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Kendall's tau tests, and multivariate logistic regression procedures were performed.Conclusions:More than half of the participants were either overweight or obese (56.5{\%}). The mean nutrition knowledge score was 74.1{\%}, and only 28.1{\%} correctly identified the body mass index for obesity. Positive predictors of overweight and obesity included poor eating self-regulation of giving up too easily on eating intentions (odds ratio [OR] = 3.81), male gender (OR = 2.0), and age (OR = 1.03), whereas nutrition attitudes were a negative predictor (OR = 0.74).Implications for practice:The odds of overweight or obesity were nearly four times greater for those who gave up too easily on their eating intentions. Nurse practitioners can play a critical role in establishing healthy dietary habits to maintain weight control by promoting good eating self-regulation, despite the current obesogenic environment. After assessing patient readiness and motivation, it is important to help patients make eating self-regulation as manageable as possible to promote long-term weight management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has continued to rise in prevalence globally. Its association with many chronic diseases is posing a large threat to public health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to examine briefly the nature and complexity of the problem of obesity and to present evidence about the elements of the built environment that are associated with obesity. DISCUSSION: Management of obesity is far more complex than just requiring people to 'eat less and exercise more'. Social and environmental drivers are known to influence an individual's decisions about healthy behaviour. Some elements of the built environment shown to be associated with obesity are urban sprawl, urban design, land-use mix, transport systems, access to and type of food outlets, and building design. This evidence augments the current individual clinical management of obesity by providing guidance to advocates of health and regulators so they are able to design and create environments that foster healthy eating and personal activity.},

abstract = {Central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) networks are recruited by chronic stressors and elevated glucocorticoids (GCs) that initiate recruitment of central CRF activity in the amygdala. Increased central activity of the CRF network stimulates all monoaminergic cell groups, as well as premotor autonomic and other limbic structures resulting in the typical arousal, behavioral changes, autonomic, and neuroendocrine changes that accompany the chronic imposition of a stressor. By contrast, elevated GCs appear, through a variety of means to counteract the effects of central CRF, which they have initiated. Together with insulin, the GCs stimulate drive for and ingestion of "comfort foods" that may directly result in reduction of the negative effects of the chronic stressor in the nucleus Accumbens, through stimulation of the anterior, more pleasure-associated part of this cell group, thus reducing the weight of the stress-stimulated posterior, more defensive part. Furthermore, the shift in caloric intake from chow to preference for "comfort foods," together with elevated GCs and insulin, reorganize energy stores from a peripheral to a central distribution, primarily as abdominal fat. A signal associated with this fat depot appears, as with eating "comfort foods," to reduce the influence of the chronic stress network on behaviors, autonomic, and neuroendocrine outflow. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective: To determine low-income consumers' attitudes and behaviour towards fruit and vegetables, in particular issues of access to, affordability of and motivation to eat fruit and vegetables. Design and setting: Questionnaire survey mailed to homes owned by a large UK housing association. Participants: Participants were 680 low-income men and women, aged 17-100 years. Results: Age, employment, gender, smoking and marital status all affected attitudes towards access, affordability and motivation to eat fruit and vegetables. Few (7{\%}) participants experienced difficulty in visiting a supermarket at least once a week, despite nearly half having no access to a car for shopping. Fruit and vegetables were affordable to this low-income group in the amounts they habitually bought; purchasing additional fruits and vegetables was seen as prohibitively expensive. Less than 5{\%} felt they had a problem with eating healthily and yet only 18{\%} claimed to eat the recommended 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables every day. Conclusions: Supported by research, current UK Government policy is driven by the belief that low-income groups have difficulties in access to and affordability of fruit and vegetables. Findings from this particular group suggest that, of the three potential barriers, access and affordability were only a small part of the 'problem' surrounding low fruit and vegetable consumption. Thus, other possible determinants of greater consequence need to be identified. We suggest focusing attention on motivation to eat fruit and vegetables, since no dietary improvement can be achieved if people do not recognise there is a problem.},

@article{Mela2001,
abstract = {The decision to eat, and to eat particular foods, varies for different individuals and situations. Individual differences in food likes and desires develop throughout life because of differing food experiences and attitudes. There are many internal and external cues, not just stimulation from foods or hunger, which can trigger the immediate desire to eat or orient eating toward certain foods. Food desires and intake are an outcome of interactions between these cues and more stable individual physiological and psychological characteristics. Overweight and obese individuals show a tendency toward greater liking and selection of energy-dense foods, which may contribute to development and maintenance of these conditions. However, although liking (pleasure from eating) is an important part of food choice, it may make only a modest contribution to overall variation in food choice and eating behaviors. Indeed, difficulties of weight control may reflect problems with cues and motivations to eat, rather than with heightened pleasure derived from eating. Paradoxically, individuals highly concerned with food intake and weight control may be particularly susceptible to thoughts, emotions, and situational cues that can prompt overeating and undermine their attempts to restrain eating. Repeat dieting, high day-to-day fluctuations in intakes, and attempts to enforce highly rigid control over eating all seem to be counterproductive to weight control efforts and may disrupt more appropriate food choice behaviors. Longer-term weight maintenance solutions and programs that offer a degree of structuring of the personal food environment, while retaining flexibility in choices, therefore, may be particularly beneficial in weight management.},

It evokes language of blame, weakness, and vice and is a leading basis for inadequate government efforts, given the importance of environmental conditions in explaining high rates of obesity. These environmental conditions can override individual physical and psychological regulatory systems that might otherwise stand in the way of weight gain and obesity, hence undermining personal responsibility, narrowing choices, and eroding personal freedoms. Personal responsibility can be embraced as a value by placing priority on legislative and regulatory actions such as improving school nutrition, menu labeling, altering industry marketing practices, and even such controversial measures as the use of food taxes that create healthier defaults, thus supporting responsible behavior and bridging the divide between views based on individualistic versus collective responsibility. {\textcopyright} 2010 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.},

Data were gathered in 1997-1999 and 2003-2004. Sleep duration and other covariates were assessed. Changes in body mass index and waist circumference were assessed between the two phases. The incidence of obesity (body mass index: ≥30 kg/m2) was assessed among nonobese participants at baseline. In cross-sectional analyses (n = 5,021), there were significant, inverse associations (p {\textless} 0.001) between duration of sleep and both body mass index and waist circumference.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that obese persons experience significant impairments in quality of life as a result of their obesity, with greater impairments associated with greater degrees of obesity. Weight loss has been shown to improve quality of life in obese persons undergoing a variety of treatments. Further research is needed to clarify whether quality of life differs among subsets of obese persons. Until recently, there has been little standardization of quality of life measures in obesity.

Setting: General adult population of the United Kingdom. Participants: 36 324 households with data on product level household expenditure from UK Kantar FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) panel for January 2012 to December 2013. Data were used to estimate changes in energy (kcal, 1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) purchase associated with a 20{\%} price increase in high sugar snacks. Data for 2544 adults from waves 5 to 8 of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2012-16) were used to estimate resulting changes in BMI and prevalence of obesity. Main outcome measures: The effect on per person take home energy purchases of a 20{\%} price increase for three categories of high sugar snacks: confectionery (including chocolate), biscuits, and cakes. Health outcomes resulting from the price increase were measured as changes in weight, BMI (not overweight (BMI {\textless}25), overweight (BMI ≥25 and {\textless}30), and obese (BMI ≥30)), and prevalence of obesity. Results were stratified by household income and BMI. Results: For income groups combined, the average reduction in energy consumption for a 20{\%} price increase in high sugar snacks was estimated to be 8.9×10 3 kcal (95{\%} confidence interval -13.1×10 3 to -4.2×10 3 kcal). Using a static weight loss model, BMI was estimated to decrease by 0.53 (95{\%} confidence interval -1.01 to -0.06) on average across all categories and income groups. This change could reduce the UK prevalence of obesity by 2.7 percentage points (95{\%} confidence interval -3.7 to -1.7 percentage points) after one year. The impact of a 20{\%} price increase in high sugar snacks on energy purchase was largest in low income households classified as obese and smallest in high income households classified as not overweight. Conclusions: Increasing the price of high sugar snacks by 20{\%} could reduce energy intake, BMI, and prevalence of obesity. This finding was in a UK context and was double that modelled for a similar price increase in sugar sweetened beverages.},

abstract = {Sleep is a biological imperative associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. As such, a thorough discussion of the sociocultural and demographic determinants of sleep is warranted, if not overdue. This paper begins with a brief review of the laboratory and epidemiologic evidence linking sleep deficiency, which includes insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, with increased risk of chronic cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Identification of the determinants of sleep deficiency is the critical next step to understanding the role sleep plays in human variation in health and disease. Therefore, the majority of this paper describes the different biopsychosocial determinants of sleep, including age, gender, psychosocial factors (depression, stress and loneliness), socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. In addition, because sleep duration is partly determined by behavior, it will be shaped by cultural values, beliefs and practices. Therefore, possible cultural differences that may impact sleep are discussed. If certain cultural, ethnic or social groups are more likely to experience sleep deficiency, then these differences in sleep could increase their risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, if the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of sleep deficiency in certain populations can be identified, interventions could be developed to target these mechanisms, reduce sleep differences and potentially reduce cardiometabolic disease risk. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most research into the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of obesity has taken environment to mean behaviours such as exercise and diet. While interesting, this is somewhat at odds with research into the social determinants of obesity, in which the focus has shifted away from individuals and behaviours to the types of wider obesogenic environments in which individuals live, which influence and produce these behaviours. This study combines these two strands of research by investigating how the genetic influence on body mass index (BMI), used as a proxy for obesity, changes across different neighbourhood environments measured by levels of deprivation. Genetics are incorporated using a classical twin design with data from Twins UK, a longitudinal study of UK twins running since 1992. A multilevel modelling approach is taken to decompose variation between individuals into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components. Neighbourhood deprivation is found to be a statistically significant predictor of BMI after conditioning on individual characteristics, and a heritability of 0.75 is estimated for the entire sample. This heritability estimate is shown, however, to be higher in more deprived neighbourhoods and lower in less deprived ones, and this relationship is statistically significant. While this research cannot say anything directly about the mechanisms behind the relationship, it does highlight how the relative importance of genetic factors can vary across different social environments, and therefore the value of considering both genetic and social determinants of health simultaneously.},

abstract = {Effective treatment of personality disorder (PD) presents a clinical conundrum. Many of the behaviors constitutive of PD cause harm to self and others. Encouraging service users to take responsibility for this behavior is central to treatment. Blame, in contrast, is detrimental. How is it possible to hold service users responsible for harm to self and others without blaming them? A solution to this problem is part conceptual, part practical. I offer a conceptual framework that clearly distinguishes between ideas of responsibility, blameworthiness, and blame. Within this framework, I distinguish two sorts of blame, which I call 'detached' and 'affective'. Affective, not detached, blame is detrimental to effective treatment. I suggest that the practical demand to avoid affective blame is largely achieved through attention to PD service users' past history. Past history does not eliminate responsibility and blameworthiness. Instead, it directly evokes compassion and empathy, which compete with affective blame. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.},

abstract = {Background: The global rise in obesity prevalence among children and adolescents has been linked to modifiable lifestyle factors, including lack of physical activity. However, no known meta-analysis has been conducted on the effects of exercise intervention on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adolescents. Objectives: The aim of this study was to (1) estimate whether exercise intervention meaningfully improves body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adolescents; and (2) discuss the implications of the findings in terms of primary healthcare provision and public health policy, using New Zealand as an exemplar context. Data Sources: Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar) from inception to May 2015. The reference lists of eligible articles and relevant reviews were also checked. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized controlled trial; (2) structured exercise intervention, alone or combined with any other kind of intervention; (3) control group received no structured exercise or behavioural modification designed to increase physical activity; (4) participants overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥85th percentile); and (5) participants aged between 10 and 19 years. Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Initially, 1667 articles were identified. After evaluation of study characteristics, quality and validity, data from 13 articles (15 trials) involving 556 participants (176 male, 193 female, 187 unknown) were extracted for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses were completed on five body composition parameters and ten cardiometabolic parameters. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated as mean differences, as well as standardized mean differences in order to determine effect magnitude. Results: Exercise intervention reduced BMI (mean 2.0 kg/m2, 95 {\%} CI 1.5–2.5; ES moderate), body weight (mean 3.7 kg, 95 {\%} CI 1.7–5.8; ES small), body fat percentage (3.1 {\%}, 95 {\%} CI 2.2–4.1; ES small), waist circumference (3.0 cm, 95 {\%} CI 1.3–4.8; ES small), but the increase (improvement) in lean mass was trivial (mean 1.6 kg, 95 {\%} CI 0.5–2.6). The response to an oral glucose tolerance test following exercise intervention was for a decrease in the area under the curve for insulin (mean 162 $\mu$U/$\mu$l, 95 {\%} CI 93–231; ES large) and blood glucose (mean 39 mg/dl, 95 {\%} CI 9.4–69; ES moderate). Improvements in the homeostatic model assessment were also noted (mean 1.0, 95 {\%} CI 0.7–1.4; ES moderate) and systolic blood pressure (mean 7.1 mmHg, 95 {\%} CI 3.5–10.7; ES moderate). The effects of exercise on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting insulin and fasting blood glucose were inconclusive. Limitations: Most of the included trials were short term (6–36 weeks) and 13 had methodological limitations. Additionally, the meta-analyses for some of the secondary outcomes had a small number of participants or substantial statistical heterogeneity. Conclusions: The current evidence suggests that exercise intervention in overweight and obese adolescents improves body composition, particularly by lowering body fat. The limited available evidence further indicates that exercise intervention may improve some cardiometabolic risk factors.},

Yet, there is con ceptual confusion among researchers and practitioners about the interrelationships of these theories and variables. This article attempts to show how these explanatory fac tors may be related, and in so doing, posits a revised explanatory model which incor porates self-efficacy into the Health Belief Model. Specifically, self-efficacy is pro posed as a separate independent variable along with the traditional health belief var iables of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers. Incentive to behave (health motivation) is also a component of the model. Locus of control is not included explicitly because it is believed to be incorporated within other elements of the model. It is predicted that the new formulation will more fully account for health-related behavior than did earlier formulations, and will suggest more effective behavioral interventions than have hitherto been available to health educators. {\textcopyright} 1988, Sage Publications.

Objective To determine if lack of nutrition knowledge has a positive impact on eating behaviors using obesity status as an indicator. Design Participants completed the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ), Anonymous Demographic Questionnaire (ADQ), and anthropometric measurements were taken during a one-time meeting lasting about one hour. Participants/Setting Data collection was completed on 334 participants between the ages of 18-55 years in a southern California community sample. Intervention Anthropometric measurements were collected by the research team and consisted of waist circumference, height, weight, and Bio-impedance analysis. Main Outcome Measures Questionnaires were scored by the researchers using a predefined answer guide. Statistical Analyses Performed Statistical analysis was completed using Mann-Whitney Test for multiple comparisons. Results There was no significant difference between mean GNKQ {\%} score for gender (p=.21); Table 1. There was a significant difference between mean GNKQ {\%} score for the age group and income (p=.02 and p=.04, respectively); Table 1. There was a significant difference between GNKQ {\%} score for normal vs. overweight BMI class (p=.001) and with overweight vs obese BMI class (p=.001); Table 2. There was no significant difference between mean GNKQ {\%} score for male waist circumference {\textless} 40 vs. ≥ 40 (p=.49). However, there was a significant difference between mean GNKQ {\%} score for female waist circumference {\textless}35 vs. ≥ 35 (p=.002); Table 2. Conclusions Obesity is multifactorial and thus cannot be pinned on any one factor such as diet, exercise or nutrition knowledge. There is potential benefit to implement nutrition intervention during this obesity epidemic. Our findings suggest that participants who were obese, had lower nutrition knowledge than those who were of normal BMI. Lack of nutrition knowledge may be one of the many contributing factors for obesity.},

abstract = {A link between higher rates of childhood obesity and deprivation has been noted in the UK, as well as several other European countries and the US. The drivers of obesity are complex and multi‐factorial, but socially and economically disadvantaged groups may be more vulnerable to many of these. Evidence that rates of obesity are rising faster in low‐income population groups, resulting in widening inequalities indicates that prevention policies must take account of socio‐economic factors. It has been suggested that community‐wide approaches placing less emphasis on individual responsibility or 'agency' (i.e. have less emphasis on aspects that require cognitive, psychological and material resources and time) can be more effective and equitable. This paper outlines examples of community approaches that may have contributed to the reported reductions in childhood obesity in some areas, particularly amongst deprived groups including Health, Exercise and Nutrition in the Really Young in Leeds, UK; Ensemble Pr{\'{e}}venons l'Ob{\'{e}}sit{\'{e}} Des Enfants and Amsterdam's citywide Healthy Weight Programme. The policies enacted that improved the nutrition environment and increased opportunities for physical activity in four US sites (the Childhood Obesity Declines project) are also considered. It is clear that there is no silver bullet for tackling childhood obesity. A whole systems approach that takes into account more holistically the reasons why healthy diet and lifestyles may be less available to families on low incomes is needed.},

However, it is unclear what the slogan means, whether it is true, and what the consequences would be or should be if it is. A careful examina tion of the contexts in which the notion of personal responsibility for health occurs re veals a number of distinct arguments for different policy ends, each relying in turn on key unstated assumptions whose validity is doubtful. There is no disputing the minimal claim that most of us would be healthier if we took better care of ourselves. However, assignment of responsibility for health to the individual is usually part of a more far- reaching reassessment of obligations and entitlements in health care and health policy. A assessment of the concept of personal responsibility for health should precede any attempt to draw broad conclusions on rights and duties in maintaining health. {\textcopyright} 1987, Sage Publications.

abstract = {The simultaneous increases in obesity in almost all countries seem to be driven mainly by changes in the global food system, which is producing more processed, affordable, and effectively marketed food than ever before. This passive overconsumption of energy leading to obesity is a predictable outcome of market economies predicated on consumption-based growth. The global food system drivers interact with local environmental factors to create a wide variation in obesity prevalence between populations. Within populations, the interactions between environmental and individual factors, including genetic makeup, explain variability in body size between individuals. However, even with this individual variation, the epidemic has predictable patterns in subpopulations. In low-income countries, obesity mostly affects middle-aged adults (especially women) from wealthy, urban environments; whereas in high-income countries it affects both sexes and all ages, but is disproportionately greater in disadvantaged groups. Unlike other major causes of preventable death and disability, such as tobacco use, injuries, and infectious diseases, there are no exemplar populations in which the obesity epidemic has been reversed by public health measures. This absence increases the urgency for evidence-creating policy action, with a priority on reduction of the supply-side drivers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Methods: We used national cross-sectional data (Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals) on 4356 US adults, aged 20-65 years, collected in 1994-1996. Socio-economic factors considered were education and poverty income ratio. Nutrition knowledge and belief score was measured by principal components analysis of 11 question responses. We considered three binary and two continuous outcomes related to United States Department of Agriculture recommended intake of fruits and vegetables and overall diet quality through Healthy Eating Index and alternate Mediterranean Diet Score. Results: Multivariate analyses indicated that better SES independently improved likelihood of adequate fruits and vegetables intake and overall diet quality. In several cases, nutrition knowledge and beliefs acted as an effect modifier. In particular, education showed no association with diet quality among subjects in the lowest nutrition knowledge and belief tertile, while the association was consistently stronger in the highest tertile (Education × Nutrition knowledge and beliefs interaction term P {\textless} 0.10 for Healthy Eating Index and both fruits and vegetables guidelines). A similar interaction was noted for poverty income ratio. Conclusion: For improvement in overall diet quality, socio-economic interventions must be coupled with health education programs targeting all segments of the US population. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Although eating behaviour cannot be considered “addictive” under normal circumstances, people can become “addicted” to this behaviour, similarly to how some people are addicted to drugs. The symptoms, cravings and causes of “eating addiction” are remarkably similar to those experienced by drug addicts, and both drug-seeking behaviour as eating addiction share the same neural pathways. However, while the drug addiction process has been highly characterised, eating addiction is a nascent field. In fact, there is still a great controversy over the concept of “food addiction”. This review aims to summarize the most relevant animal models of “eating addictive behaviour”, emphasising binge eating disorder, that could help us to understand the neurobiological mechanisms hidden under this behaviour, and to improve the psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment in patients suffering from these pathologies.},

abstract = {Purpose - "Male" and "low-income" are both risk factors for eating a nutritionally sub-standard diet. The aim of the study was to explore the attitudes and experiences of typical low-income males towards food and health. Information would build upon that previously obtained from a matched group of women, providing the opportunity to explore possible gender issues. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach was used to meet the study aims. Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted in 2001 with eleven middle-aged men who were typical of a substantial low-income sub-group. Interviews focussed upon the issues of cancer prevention and fruits and vegetables. Transcripts were analysed using an established interpretative phenomenological approach. Findings - Previous life-experiences and control beliefs concerning personal health were key themes influencing dietary attitudes and behaviours. Lack of food/health information and access to healthy foods were not significant factors. Although money was limiting, this in itself, did not prevent the men from eating appropriately. Core findings were similar (with certain exceptions) to those reported previously for a comparable group of women. Research limitations/implications - Further studies are needed to test the transferability of these findings to low-income men of different age, region and ethnicity, as well as to more affluent men. Practical implications - Greater emphasis on sociological frameworks is needed in both the setting of public health nutrition policies and in how food and nutrition is taught in schools. The potential dangers of stigmatising "the poor" as consumers of "bad" diets should be considered. Originality/value - Simplistic statistical correlations do not adequately explain the complex causes of unhealthy diets and a greater emphasis upon social and cultural dynamics is required. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of twonights of sleep restriction on neuroendocrine hormones (i.e. peptide YY [PYY], ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1, adiponectin, and leptin) involved in regulating body weight. Ten healthy male adults aged 18 to 23 years were subjected to two consecutive nights of sleep restriction. Compared to a night of normal sleep, sleep restriction was associated with a significant reduction in PYY levels (P = 0.047) and a significant reduction in satiety levels (P = 0.033). These results suggest that sleep restriction alters the hormonal regulation of appetite in a manner predictive of increased energy intake. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.},

abstract = {Background: Good sleep quality is essential for recovery. The risk factors of sleep disorders have been extensively investigated, but there is sparse information on the association of socioeconomic factors with a person's sleep quality. The aim of the present analysis is to investigate this association, taking particularly the effect of health confounders into consideration. Methods: The data were extracted from the cross-sectional QUEBEB Study. In total, the study sample consisted of 3281 participants (1817 women and 1464 men, aged 16-72 years). Here socioeconomic status (SES) was collected from the baseline survey taken in 2004. Sleep quality for the same participants was measured with in-depth personal interviews in 2006 using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, together with other relevant characteristics (e.g. anxiety, depression and health status). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: People living in an urban environment with a high or medium SES have a greater probability of good sleep quality (odds ratio 1.65, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.27-2.14; odds ratio 1.40, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.16-1.69) than persons with a low SES. Anxiety and depression, but also health status, are also associated with sleep quality and can influence in part the socioeconomic levels seen in sleep quality. Conclusion: SES and sleep quality are associated. However, there are important additional determinants that influence the level of association between SES and sleep quality. Several factors, such as anxiety, depression and health status, are associated with poorer sleep quality, but at the same time, these factors occur more often within lower social classes.},

abstract = {This paper argues against incorporating assessments of individual responsibility into healthcare policies by expanding an existing argument and offering a rebuttal to an argument in favour of such policies. First, it is argued that what primarily underlies discussions surrounding personal responsibility and healthcare is not causal responsibility, moral responsibility or culpability, as one might expect, but biases towards particular highly stigmatised behaviours. A challenge is posed for proponents of taking personal responsibility into account within health policy to either expand the debate to also include socially accepted behaviours or to provide an alternative explanation of the narrowly focused discussion. Second, a critical response is offered to arguments that claim that policies based on personal responsibility would lead to several positive outcomes including healthy behaviour change, better health outcomes and decreases in healthcare spending. It is argued that using individual responsibility as a basis for resource allocation in healthcare is unlikely to motivate positive behaviour changes, and is likely to increase inequality which may lead to worse health outcomes overall. Finally, the case of West Virginia's Medicaid reform is examined, which raises a worry that policies focused on personal responsibility have the potential to lead to increases in medical spending overall.},

This chapter investigates a number of views seeking to explain this weak link. Often, the lack of impact of researchers is located in their poor understanding of policy–making dynamics. Accordingly, a second focus to the discussion here is upon the policy process. However, there are no clear steps, strategies, tool–kits or guidelines that will guarantee successful use of research by decision–makers. Instead, the method and degree of ‘knowledge utilisation' is shaped by a host of factors that are peculiar to leadership styles, institutional architecture and political culture of a country or policy domain.},

It looks at the nature of the emerging governance system and the role it attributes to NGOs, then raises questions for this system by looking at the operational characteristics of NGOs in context. In conclusion, it suggests that although NGOs have been important actors in this field, they do not have the sort of agency required for sus tainable long-term policy interventions in the HIV/AIDS .},

These vexing questions have been the subject of considerable interest and debate in recent years, driven in large part by the major health concerns associated with dramatically increasing body weights and rates of obesity in the United States, Europe, and other regions with developed economies. No clear consensus has yet emerged on the validity of the concept of food addiction and whether some individuals who struggle to control their food intake can be considered food addicts. Some, including Fletcher, have argued that the concept of food addiction is unsupported, as many of the defining features of drug addiction are not seen in the context of feeding behaviors. Others, Kenny included, have argued that food and drug addiction share similar features that may reflect common underlying neural mechanisms. Here, Fletcher and Kenny argue the merits of these opposing positions on the concept of food addiction.},

@article{Dallman2003,
abstract = {The effects of adrenal corticosteroids on subsequent adrenocorticotropin secretion are complex. Acutely (within hours), glucocorticoids (GCs) directly inhibit further activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, but the chronic actions (across days) of these steroids on brain are directly excitatory. Chronically high concentrations of GCs act in three ways that are functionally congruent. (i) GCs increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala, a critical node in the emotional brain. CRF enables recruitment of a chronic stress-response network. (i) GCs increase the salience of pleasurable or compulsive activities (ingesting sucrose, fat, and drugs, or wheel-running). This motivates ingestion of "comfort food." (iii) GCs act systemically to increase abdominal fat depots. This allows an increased signal of abdominal energy stores to inhibit catecholamines in the brainstem and CRF expression in hypothalamic neurons regulating adrenocorticotropin. Chronic stress, together with high GC concentrations, usually decreases body weight gain in rats; by contrast, in stressed or depressed humans chronic stress induces either increased comfort food intake and body weight gain or decreased intake and body weight loss. Comfort food ingestion that produces abdominal obesity, decreases CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. Depressed people who overeat have decreased cerebrospinal CRF, catecholamine concentrations, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity. We propose that people eat comfort food in an attempt to reduce the activity in the chronic stress-response network with its attendant anxiety. These mechanisms, determined in rats, may explain some of the epidemic of obesity occurring in our society.},

This paper explores the role that poverty may play in driving the present obesity epidemic. Current literature supports a food choice constraint model in which one's ability to purchase healthy foods falls with income in a standard budget constraint shift fashion because healthy foods (non-energy-dense foods) are relatively costly. This model is reinforced by a biological preference for energy-dense foods. Theoretically, a tax on energy-dense food would reduce the prevalence of obesity, along with obesity-related disease, and therefore should be carefully considered by the American people.},

abstract = {The present study focused on the role of the Health Belief Model (HBM) in predicting willingness to use functional breads, across four European countries: UK (N = 552), Italy (N = 504), Germany (N = 525) and Finland (N = 513). The behavioural evaluation components of the HBM (the perceived benefits and barriers conceptualized respectively as perceived healthiness and pleasantness) and the health motivation component were good predictors of willingness to use functional breads whereas threat perception components (perceived susceptibility and perceived anticipated severity) failed as predictors. This result was common in all four countries and across products. The role of 'cue to action' was marginal. On the whole the HBM fit was similar across the countries and products in terms of significant predictors (the perceived benefits, barriers and health motivation) with the exception of self-efficacy which was significant only in Finland. Young consumers seemed more interested in the functional bread with a health claim promoting health rather than in reducing risk of disease, whereas the opposite was true for older people. However, functional staple foods, such as bread in this European study, are still perceived as common foods rather than as a means of avoiding diseases. Consumers seek these foods for their healthiness (the perceived benefits) as they expect them to be healthier than regular foods and for the pleasantness (the perceived barriers) as they do not expect any change in the sensory characteristics due to the addition of the functional ingredients. The importance of health motivation in willingness to use products with health claims implies that there is an opening for developing better models for explaining health-promoting food choices that take into account both food and health-related factors without making a reference to disease-related outcome. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The role personal responsibility should play in healthcare provision has growing pertinence given the growing significance of individual lifestyle choices for health. Media reporting focussing on the 'bad behaviour' of individuals suffering lifestyle-related disease, and policies aimed at encouraging 'responsibilisation' in healthcare highlight the importance of understanding the scope of responsibility ascriptions in this context. Research into the social determinants of health and psychological mechanisms of health behaviour could undermine some commonly held and tacit assumptions about the moral responsibility of agents for the sorts of lifestyles they adopt. I use Philip Petit's conception of freedom as 'fitness to be held responsible' to consider the significance of some of this evidence for assessing the moral responsibility of agents. I propose that, in some cases, factors outside the agent's control may influence behaviour in such a way as to undermine her freedom along the three dimensions described by Pettit: freedom of action; a sense of identification with one's actions; and whether one's social position renders one vulnerable to pressure from more powerful others.},

In this article the main arguments for and the traditional arguments against the use of individual responsibility as a criterion for the distribution of scarce health resources will be briefly outlined.

Overall, study quality was low; 60 studies were cross-sectional. Associations between food outlet availability and obesity were predominantly null. Among non-null associations, we saw a trend toward inverse associations between supermarket availability and obesity (22 negative, 4 positive, 67 null) and direct associations between fast food and obesity (29 positive, 6 negative, 71 null) in adults. We saw direct associations between fast food availability and obesity in lower income children (12 positive, 7 null). Indices including multiple food outlets were most consistently associated with obesity in adults (18 expected, 1 not expected, 17 null). Limiting to higher quality studies did not affect results. Conclusions Despite the large number of studies, we found limited evidence for associations between local food environments and obesity.

abstract = {The analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a relatively new strategy to measure long-term cumulative cortisol levels, which is increasingly used in psychoneuroendocrinological research. Here, we conduct a first comprehensive meta-analysis of HCC research based on aggregated data from a total of 124 (sub)samples (66 independent studies; total N = 10,289). We seek to answer two central questions: (i) Which covariates and basic features of HCC need to be considered in future research? (ii) What are the main determinants of HCC in terms of chronic stress exposure and mental health? Concerning basic characteristics, our findings identify several covariates to be considered (age, sex, hair washing frequency, hair treatment, oral contraceptive use), confirm a decline of HCC from the first to the second proximal 3 cm hair segment, and show positive associations between HCC and short-term salivary cortisol measures. Regarding chronic stress, we show that stress-exposed groups on a whole exhibit 22{\%} increased HCC. This long-term cortisol hypersecretion emerges particularly when stress is still ongoing at the time of study (+43{\%} HCC) but is not present in conditions of past/absent stress (-9{\%} HCC, n.s.). We also report evidence for 17{\%}-reduced HCC in anxiety disorders, such as PTSD. Interestingly, no consistent associations with mood disorders and self-reports of perceived stress, depressiveness or social support are found. However, our findings reveal positive associations of HCC with stress-related anthropometric (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio) and hemodynamic measures (systolic blood pressure). These meta-analytic results are discussed in the light of their practical implications and important areas for future inquiry are outlined.},

@article{Hansson2015,
abstract = {J.S. Mill's advocacy of liberty was based only in part on his harm principle. He also endorsed two other principles that considerably extend the scope of liberty: first, a principle of individual liberty that is based on the value of positive freedom and of developing individuality, and second, a principle of free trade or economic freedom that is based on the value of economic efficiency. An analysis is offered of how these three principles are combined in Mill's account of liberty and how they connect with his antipaternalism. It is proposed that his appeal in On Liberty to positive freedom and the development of individuality provides a uniting principle that makes his view on liberty cohere with his utilitarianism.
